## README for Eytukan, Kelutral.org's custom Discord Bot

Eytukan (kelutral-bot) was coded by **Seth Wright** (http://twitter.com/makoryht) in Python 3 using the Discord.py library and API to meet specific needs for the Kelutral.org Discord Na'vi Language community. Brief descriptions of those functionalities are as follows:

**Integration with Horen**\n
Eytukan can search and retrieve coded language rules for assisting in teaching learners of the Na'vi language. The original Horen document has been adapted for use with Discord. More information, including license, can be found in `cogs/utility/license.txt`

**Integration with a Na'vi Dictionary**\n
Eytukan can search and retrieve word entries from the latest Na'vi Language dictionary release.

**Generation of Na'vi Names**\n
Eytukan can create phonetically correct Na'vi names.

**Na'vi Language Vocabulary Quizzing**\n
Eytukan can quiz learners on their vocabulary knowledge, in either English > Na'vi or Na'vi > English.
