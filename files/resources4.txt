Ayseng Alahe: Other Discords
--------
```
**Tskengwi√§ Olo'**
An immersion server (Na'vi only chatting) to practice speaking and reading Na'vi without the temptation of switching back to a native tongue.

**The Neytiri Project**
This Discord server is for those who would rather work privately 1 on 1 with a dedicated tutor. 
Due to high-volume of students and low-volume of tutors, the project is mostly on hiatus. Inquire with @Mako for further information.

**Lerngruppe**
This Discord server is for German speaking Na'vi Students to find active lessons and tutors in their natural language.
