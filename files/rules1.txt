**Home.**
Every member of the Kelutral.org family should feel safe, and that they have a place here. This is a central gathering place where fans of all stripes can chat, learn, and share a passion for Avatar and the Na'vi language.

Though we will have differences of opinion and heated debate, we acknowledge that there's a person on the other end of the screen who also really cares about this, even if you think they are wrong.

**Growth.**
Our aim is to grow the community of Na'vi language learners and teachers. We believe that every new Na'vi speaker is valuable to that mission, and will strive to support the many different ways people learn and practice. We will also be vigilant in outreach- not waiting for others to come to us, but to find them where they are.

Anybody of any skill level is where they are through combined efforts of those that came before. Any figures of leadership exist to work with members in a transparent manner, as they too are part of, not above, the community.

To that end, we have the following rules to maintain these values:
