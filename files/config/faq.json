		"lu"   : "A common beginner mistake is to use **lu** alongside verbs to indicate the progressive 'verbing' aspect. Instead, Na'vi has its own infix which indicates this aspect of a verb, **<er>**, which fits into the first position. Example: **h__er__angham**, 'laughing'",
		"with" : "A common beginner mistake is to interchange **hu** and **fa** for 'with' without distinction. **Hu** is the more traditional 'with', while **fa** is 'by means of, using' as in 'with a tool'. \n\nExample: \n**oe tswayon fa ikran**, 'I fly __with/via__ an ikran'"
