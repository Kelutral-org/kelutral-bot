# 2. You will not put down others for honest attempts at learning.
```
First and foremost, Kelutral is a learning community. Making mistakes is an integral part of the learning process and should be celebrated, not scolded or insulted. Any behavior or messages discouraging others from learning will not be tolerated.

Thus, the following behavior is forbidden:
* Insulting the intelligence of others
* Putting down others for making mistakes
* Discouraging others from attempting to learn
* Discouraging the use of the Na'vi language

# 3. You will not engage in attention-seeking behavior.
```
You are not owed anything, attention included. We are not here to be an audience to you. We are a community, and expect members to respect that community. It's okay to be proud of your work, but if you see our discord as just another place to advertise, you will get the same welcoming as a door-to-door salesman.

Thus, the following behavior is forbidden:
* Spamming/repeated messages or emotes
* Unsolicited advertising (sharing links when relevant to conversation is okay)
* Repeated patterns attention-seeking behavior
* Pestering others to "say something"
* Chain messages (copy/paste this to other Discords) are spam and are strictly forbidden.
