4. You will respect the public nature of the space.
```

Kelutral is a space for all kinds of learners, from all over the world, in all age groups (13+ as per Discord rules), who speak all kinds of languages. We want to maintain a great environment for our primary goals of learning and conversing. If someone asks you to stop doing something, it's probably for a good reason.

Thus, the following behavior is forbidden:
* NSFW content (keep it PG-13)
* Streaming music in voice channels (this is specific to streaming music and excludes streaming video games or other media via Discord's "Go Live" feature.)
* Voice spam in audio channels (screaming, yelling, noise for the sake of noise). Please use push-to-talk or mute yourself if you are in a noisy environment!
* Excessive and repeated cursing. 
* Targeted cursing (i.e. "f--- you") should be minimized, reactionary cursing (i.e. "f--- yeah") is permitted within reason.
