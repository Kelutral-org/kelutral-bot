{"Zola&#8217;u n\u00ecprrte&#8217;! Welcome!": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2010/06/first-post/", "content": "My friends,\n\n\n**Zola\u2019u n\u00ecprrte\u2019 ayngaru n\u00ecwotx! **Welcome to you all! It\u2019s a pleasure to post this first message to Na\u2019viteri (Concerning Na\u2019vi), my blog about the language of the inhabitants of Pandora in James Cameron\u2019s seminal film, \u201cAvatar.\u201d I hope that everyone with an interest in Na\u2019vi\u2014from the casually curious to those aspiring to mastery\u2014will find something useful here.\n\n\nI have three main goals for Na\u2019viteri that will be reflected in three different kinds of posts:\n\nThis is the place for Na\u2019vi 101, a series of friendly, progressive language lessons, starting from scratch, for beginners. Here you\u2019ll find conversations and dialogs where you\u2019ll not only see the language in written form but be able to click on a button and hear it spoken as well. You\u2019ll also find brief, non-technical grammatical explanations, passages for reading and listening comprehension, and practice exercises.\n\nI want to make one thing clear at the outset. As many of you know, a wealth of learning materials for Na\u2019vi is already available on the Internet\u2014discussion boards in at least 18 languages, Na\u2019vi language lessons, dictionaries, sound recordings, videos\u2014created by devoted fans of \u201cAvatar\u201d and Na\u2019vi who have formed a spirited and passionate Na\u2019vi Community. (You&#8217;ll find links to some of those sites under &#8220;Na&#8217;vi on the &#8216;Net&#8221; at the right.) The quality of many of these materials is extraordinarily high; the fact that talented people have put in so much time and effort to help others learn Na\u2019vi is for me a great source of pride. What I myself will present here is not intended to substitute for or supplant those materials but rather to supplement them. At times, in fact, I may refer you to a particularly clear or insightful explanation, discussion, or example that someone else has provided.\n\nIn these posts, aimed at intermediate and advanced learners, I\u2019ll be discussing various points of grammar and usage and responding to questions. I\u2019m grateful for the probing queries I\u2019ve gotten from members of the Community, many of which have helped me see where Na\u2019vi needs further elucidation and development. This blog will be a central location where I can offer suggestions and address issues of interest to those who are already using the language for communication.\n\nThis is the place for introducing new vocabulary and expressions and presenting new or extended rules of grammar and usage.\n\nWhile Na\u2019viteri will be an English/Na\u2019vi bilingual blog, there will inevitably be more English than Na\u2019vi. Ideally everything would be in both languages, but that would take more time than I have. Like all of you, I\u2019m still a learner myself and not yet at the point I can write as quickly and easily in Na\u2019vi as I can in my own native language. That said, I\u2019ll try to include as much Na\u2019vi as I can for intermediate and advanced students.\n\n\nThis is my first-ever blog\u2014and it will soon become clear, if it hasn\u2019t already, that I am very much feeling my way around. So as we go along, don\u2019t be surprised if you come across inconsistencies and errors of various kinds or if you notice changes to format and organization as I discover better ways of doing things. Your constructive comments and suggestions are always welcome. I also want to say how grateful I am for the offers of help I\u2019ve received from kind volunteers in the Community\u2014**irayo, ma oey\u00e4 eylan** (thank you, my friends); as things go along, I may indeed enlist your assistance. Right now, though, I want to acknowledge the invaluable guidance I\u2019ve received from Britton Watkins and Josh Feldman, without whose generous help I\u2019d still be scratching my head and wondering how in the world to get started. Needless to say, any mistakes or omissions are my own.\n\n\n\nAnd so . . . **Awnga sngiv\u00e4\u2019i ko!** Let\u2019s begin! Check back here soon for Na\u2019vi 101 Lesson 1 and the first posts to the discussion room.

They warmed my heart.\n\n\nA few thoughts:\n\n\n**\n\nCorrections and a note to the Na\u2019vi in my first post\n**\n\n\nThanks to everyone who pointed out some minor errors. I corrected two of them without comment soon after the post went up but missed a third, which I\u2019ve now revised, noting the edit at the bottom of the post. I plan to continue with that policy: if I catch something wrong within, say, an hour of posting, I\u2019ll fix it without comment; later than that, I\u2019ll make the correction but also indicate what was changed.\n\n\nThat correction, by the way, was to eliminate the extraneous **e** in two forms of the word **s\u00e4numvi**, \u2018lesson.\u2019 Thanks to the folks who pointed that out, and my apologies if it caused consternation! It was nothing more than a goof.\n\n\nDespite my efforts at proofreading, such things will inevitably get through. So when you see something that doesn\u2019t look right, please continue to let me know. You can do that in a public comment or a private e-mail\u2014I\u2019m perfectly happy either way! Chances are I\u2019ll respond with one of the following: (1) \u201cWhoops! That was a mistake. Thanks!\u201d (2) \u201cBoth forms\u2014the way I wrote it and the change you\u2019ve suggested\u2014are correct.\u201d (3) \u201cAlthough it may look odd, the way I wrote it is right, and here\u2019s why . . .\u201d Hopefully we\u2019ll learn something in all these situations.\n\n\nA note on **srekrr**, an adverb that usually means \u201cbefore,\u201d which as I used it in the post precipitated some discussion. (As many of you know, the form of the word is an exception to the rule: we would expect **srehrr**.) **Srekrr** means \u201cbefore (time adv.), beforehand.\u201d And \u201cbeforehand,\u201d which my dictionary defines as \u201cahead of time, in advance,\u201d shades into \u201calready.\u201d So the translation of the sentence in question\u2014**Fayupxarem\u00ec oe pay\u00e4ngkxo teri horen l\u00ec\u2019fyay\u00e4 leNa\u2019vi fpi sute a tsun srekrr tsat sivar**\u2014would be something like: \u201cIn these messages I\u2019ll chat about the rules of the Na&#8217;vi language for people who can use it ahead of time\u201d\u2014i.e., people who can already use it. **Irayo** to Wm. Annis for the excellent analysis in his learnnavi.org post.\n\n\n\n**\n\nThe language of comments\n**\n\n\nI was very impressed by the quality of the Na\u2019vi in the comments. It\u2019s so gratifying to see how far some of you have already come in using Na\u2019vi for genuine communication!\n\nAs you know, this is a bilingual blog, and comments are welcome in English, in Na\u2019vi, or in a combination of both. (And if anyone wants to leave a brief comment in another language, that\u2019s fine\u2014just please translate it so the rest of us can understand!) When it comes to all-Na\u2019vi comments, though, I\u2019ve received some feedback that I wanted to share with you.\n\nNa\u2019vi-only comments have both pros and cons:\n\nPROS: They reinforce the idea that Na\u2019vi is not a game but a means of genuine communication. They also give writers a chance to use their Na\u2019vi in a public way and give others a chance to practice their reading comprehension. Providing an English translation of every Na\u2019vi post would defeat those purposes. (For example, it\u2019s hard to resist going immediately to the translation rather than puzzling out the Na\u2019vi for yourself without help, a more productive activity.) They also give beginners a sense of how far some Community members have come and provide the incentive for them to get there themselves.\n\nCONS: Na\u2019vi-only comments are directed to a relatively small audience (assuming the blog will eventually get traffic from newcomers!) and create the sense of insiders vs. outsiders. They can be off-putting to new arrivals and curious people who have not yet learned much, if anything, of the language, who might react to the blog with, \u201cWhoa. This is much too advanced for me.\u201d And they might also imply that posters who write in English only are somehow not measuring up.\n\nPlease understand: Other than what I\u2019ve indicated above, I\u2019m not going to make rules for the language of comments. Whatever anyone prefers to do is fine\u2014and very welcome! But I\u2019m curious if people have strong feelings about this question one way or the other.\n\n\n**\n\nRequest for stories in very simple Na\u2019vi\n**\n\n\n\nFor the Na\u2019vi 101 beginner lessons, I\u2019d like to include some little stories early on\u2014short paragraphs in very easy Na\u2019vi (simple structures, simple vocabulary) that could be used for listening and/or reading comprehension. These could be about anything at all\u2014a little scenario taking place on **Eywa\u2019eveng** (Pandora) or **\u2019Rrta** (earth) involving characters from the film, characters of your own invention, animals, plants, descriptions of environments, diary entries . . . anything at all that\u2019s plausible. Although the grammar should be simple, it\u2019s not necessary that every structure be something that\u2019s already been introduced and explained. If the listener or reader understands what\u2019s going on, that will be a step towards language acquisition even if not every grammatical process has been discussed at that point.\n\n\nAlthough I\u2019ll be working on such stories myself, I think it would be fun if many of them came from you! It won\u2019t be easy\u2014writing very simply and clearly while still sounding natural is a challenge. But if this sounds like something you\u2019d like to try, by all means start thinking about it, and when you have something, send it to me in an e-mail. I\u2019ll reserve the right to edit and change things based on pedagogical considerations, but if I use your story in a lesson I\u2019ll definitely give you credit.\n\n\nMore soon. **Trr/txon lefpom!** (Have a good day/night!)\n\n\n", "new vocabulary": [], "tags": ["vocabulary", "grammar", "writing", "community", "discussion"]}, "Thoughts on ambiguity": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2010/07/thoughts-on-ambiguity/", "content": "A couple of questions have come up regarding ambiguous structures in Na\u2019vi that I thought would make a good topic for the first post in the Language Discussion section\u2014**T\u00ecp\u00e4ngkxo leL\u00ec\u2019fya**\u2014for intermediate and advanced learners.\n\n\n\nNote: These kinds of posts may be somewhat discursive, and I won\u2019t hesitate to talk about general language issues in addition to specific aspects of Na\u2019vi. If you\u2019re among the \u201cgrammatically curious,\u201d I hope you\u2019ll enjoy the discussions. But if that\u2019s not you, it\u2019s OK! Feel free to skim a post lightly or skip it entirely. Some people flourish with extensive discussions of grammar, others don\u2019t. Remember: **You don\u2019t need a conscious understanding of grammar to know a language well!** We\u2019ll be talking more about this in future posts.\nWe\u2019ll get to the Na\u2019vi examples in a moment, but first some general observations about ambiguity.\n\n\n\nLinguists say an utterance is ambiguous when it has two or more distinct interpretations. It\u2019s safe to say that **every** natural language contains ambiguous elements or structures, and these can sometimes interfere with clear communication.\n\n\n\nIn English, for example, two of the most notoriously ambiguous words are \u201cright\u201d and \u201chot.\u201d Here\u2019s a little snippet of conversation in a car that illustrates the first problem:\n\n\n\nA: So I should turn left at the next corner, correct?\n\n\n\nB: Right!\n\n\n\nAnd if someone says, \u201cThis soup is too hot for me to eat,\u201d what is she saying\u2014that the soup needs to cool down first or that it\u2019s too spicy?\n\n\n\nBut it\u2019s not just words themselves that can create ambiguity\u2014it\u2019s often a question of how words \u201chang together.\u201d (In technical terminology, the distinction is one of **lexical** vs. **structural** ambiguity.) If your friend says, \u201cI hate raw fish and onions,\u201d will he tolerate fried onions, or are all onions, raw or not, off the menu? And here\u2019s an example I\u2019ve used in my classes on Advanced Writing for Business: \u201cGive me the report you wrote on Thursday at 5:00.\u201d You\u2019ll be able to get three distinct meanings out of that one. (By the way, the reason ambiguity comes up in a writing course is that good writers need to anticipate how something they\u2019ve written that may seem perfectly clear to them might be interpreted differently by readers, and then revise their writing to reduce the possibility of misunderstanding.)\n\n\n\nOther languages have similar problems. For example, when I was studying Mandarin Chinese I learned early on that **n\u00e1n** meant \u2018male.\u2019 Then I learned it also meant \u2018south.\u2019 And then I found out it also meant \u2018difficult.\u2019 (The written forms of those three words are distinct, but the spoken forms are identical.) Before that, in my elementary German class, I came across the phrase **die Frau die das Kind liebt**, which can mean either \u201cthe woman who loves the child\u201d or \u201cthe woman who(m) the child loves.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith all this potential for ambiguity, why don\u2019t we misunderstand each other more often than we do? For two reasons: First, an utterance that\u2019s theoretically ambiguous in isolation may not be ambiguous in context\u2014the context will **disambiguate** for us. For example, if someone said, \u201cThat\u2019s a huge bill,\u201d we\u2019d interpret it one way in a budgetary discussion and another way if the speaker were on a bird-watching trip. (Such things, of course, are the stuff of puns. Some of you probably know the little story about the duck in the pharmacy. &lt;g&gt;) Second, speakers can usually find ways to rephrase things so as to eliminate ambiguity when the context doesn\u2019t help: if you order a smoked-turkey-and-Gouda sandwich (never had it but it sounds good) and it\u2019s not going to be clear whether you want your Gouda cheese smoked as well as your turkey, you can rephrase your request as either a Gouda-and-smoked-turkey-sandwich or a smoked-turkey-and-smoked-Gouda sandwich, neither of which is ambiguous in the way the original phrasing was.\n\n\n\n**\n\nTwo ambiguous structures in Na\u2019vi\n**\n\n\n\nWith that behind us, let\u2019s turn to two structures in Na\u2019vi with the potential for troublesome ambiguity.\n\n\n\n1.       __Pre-Nominal Lenition-Triggering Adpositions and Short Plurals__\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t worry\u2014this is less complicated than the heading makes it sound.\n\n\n\nAs you know, the plural prefix, **ay-**, triggers lenition, the phonological process that changes **px** to **p**, **p** to **f**, **t** to **s**, etc., in nouns beginning with a consonant that can undergo the process. (To avoid that awkward wording, I\u2019ll use \u201clenitable\u201d for these consonants, even though I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a real word. The rule then becomes: The plural prefix triggers lenition in nouns that begin with lenitable consonants.)\n\n\n\nExample: river = **kilvan**, rivers = **ayhilvan**\n\n\n\nYou also know about \u201cshort plurals\u201d for such nouns: Alternatively, rivers = simply **hilvan.**\n\n\n\nFurthermore, you know that certain adpositions\u2014among them **fpi, \u00ecl\u00e4, m\u00ec, ro, sre, **and** w\u00e4**\u2014also trigger lenition when they\u2019re pre-nominal, i.e. before a noun.\n\n\n\nExample: in the river = **m\u00ec hilvan**\n\n\nYou probably see where this is going. How do you say \u201cin the rivers\u201d?\n\n\nIf you use the full plural there\u2019s no problem: **m\u00ec ayhilvan** (Note: Although the writing doesn\u2019t change, the **m\u00ec **+ **ay**- combination is pronounced **may**. So **m\u00ec ayhilvan** is pronounced as if it were **mayhilvan**. Other examples of this process: **n\u00ecayoeng** \u2018like us, as we do\u2019 is pronounced **nayweng**; **aynantang s\u00ec ayriti** \u2018viperwolves and stingbats\u2019 is pronounced **aynantang sayriti**.)\n\n\n\nBut if you use the short plural you\u2019re back to **m\u00ec hilvan**, which is now seen to be ambiguous: it can mean either \u2018in the river\u2019 or \u2018in the rivers.\u2019\n\n\n\nIs this a problem? Not always. As we\u2019ve seen above, the context will often make the meaning clear. If someone told you he saw Neytiri swimming **m\u00ec hilvan**, chances are she was swimming in only one river at a time. By the same token, if someone said **Lu fayoang alor m\u00ec hilvan Eywa\u2019eveng\u00e4**, **hilvan** is almost certainly plural, since Pandora presumably has more than one river. (That\u2019s an assumption, although I hope a plausible one. Apparently we\u2019ll all find out a lot more about Pandoran bodies of water in Avatar 2!) But if you were told that Neytiri likes to swim **m\u00ec hilvan a lok Kelutral**, and you didn\u2019t know if there was more than one river close to Hometree, you might not interpret the message correctly.\n\n\n\nIn cases like these, speakers rely on a convention:\n\n\n\nRULE FOR PLURALS AFTER ADP+: If there is the potential for misunderstanding and the plural is intended, the full plural form is used. The lenited form without **ay-** is interpreted by default as singular.\n\n\n\n2.       __\nComparison of adjectives with **to**\n__\n\n\n\nThis one is trickier.\n\n\n\nAs you know, comparison of adjectives in Na\u2019vi is simple: There\u2019s no \u201ccomparative degree\u201d of the adjective as there is in English (old vs. older, good vs. better). You simply use the adjective in its root form along with the word **to**, which corresponds to \u2018than\u2019:\n\n\n\n(1)    Po to oe lu koak. \u2018She is older than I (am).\u2019\n\n\n\nWhat kind of word is **to**? At first glance it looks like an adposition, just as \u2018than\u2019 in English looks to many people like a preposition. In fact, however, \u2018than\u2019 is classified as a conjunction. (If it were a bona fide preposition, then \u201cShe is older than me\u201d wouldn\u2019t raise an eyebrow, whereas it\u2019s often considered substandard or at best only for informal contexts.) In my personal lexicon, I\u2019ve classified **to** as PIV\u2014that is, a pivot. (In \u201cA is ADJ-er than B\u201d constructions, B is the \u201cstandard of comparison\u201d and \u2018than\u2019 is the \u201cpivot.\u201d)\n\n\n\nIn any event, the question for us here is whether **to** **behaves** like an adposition, and the answer is yes: You can put it either before or after the noun it\u2019s connected to. In other words, \u2018than I\u2019 is either **to oe** or **oeto**, just like \u2018with me\u2019 is either **hu oe** or **oehu**.\n\n\n\nBut that means that a sentence like (2) is well formed:\n\n\n\n(2)    Poto oe lu koak. \u2018I am older than she (is).\u2019\n\n\n\nNow when Na\u2019vi is written, there\u2019s a difference between (1) and (2), even if it\u2019s a small one, which means there\u2019s no ambiguity. But what about the spoken language? (Keep in mind that writing was introduced to the Na\u2019vi by the Sawtute; it was a spoken-only language long, long before that.) If (1) and (2) sound precisely the same, then we could really be in trouble, since they say opposite things.\n\n\n\nThere are two ways out of the dilemma. One is to make sure that if you use structures like (1) and (2), you convey your intended \u201cbracketing\u201d ( **po** [**to oe**] vs. [**po to**] **oe**) with your voice, through rhythm and intonation. This is, in fact, a natural thing to do. In slow, deliberate speech it\u2019s quite simple. Here are my attempts to distinguish the two in reasonably fast speech. See if you think the difference is clear:\n\n\n\nThe other way out is simply to avoid word orders like (1) and (2) in situations where there\u2019s a danger of misunderstanding. The following sentences don\u2019t have the potential for ambiguity that (1) and (2) do:\n\n\n\n(3)    Poto lu oe koak.\n\n\n\n(4)    Po lu to oe koak.\n\n\n\n(5)    Oe lu poto koak.\n\n\n\n(6)    Oe lu to po koak.\n\n\n\nAnd many more . . .\n\n\n\n**Irayo** to kwami/roger for passing along this question from Wikibooks and to Prrton for a lucid private discussion.\n\n\n\nI just discovered that the number of posts to the fora of learnnavi.org has passed a quarter of a million. **Tewti!

Na\u2019vi has this too.\n\n\nThe diminutive marker is **\u2013tsy\u00ecp**. It\u2019s a suffix, always unstressed, which you attach to the end of a word\u2014usually a noun, but pronouns can take **\u2013tsy\u00ecp** as well. (This is unusual in Earth languages.) And you can use it productively\u2014that is, you\u2019re free to add it to most nouns, including proper nouns, and pronouns\u2014but see below.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t use the diminutive simply to indicate that something is small\u2014for that you use **h\u00ec\u2019i**. For example, \u201csmall tree\u201d is **h\u00ec\u2019ia utral/utral ah\u00ec\u2019i**, not **utraltsy\u00ecp**.  What, then, is the diminutive for? Three things:\n\n\n\n1. __To form new lexical items that originated as small versions of a noun__ but may have lost the small connotation. Since their meanings are not always predictable, words in this category are listed in the dictionary. Examples:\n\n\n\n**puk** \u2018book,\u2019 **puktsy\u00ecp** \u2018booklet, pamphlet\u2019\n\n\n\n**utral** \u2018tree,\u2019 **utraltsy\u00ecp** \u2018bush\u2019\n\n\n\n**s\u00e4spxin** \u2018illness, disease,\u2019 **s\u00e4spxintsy\u00ecp** \u2018minor ailment\u2019\n\n\n\nNote that you can modify many of these words with **tsawl** without contradicting yourself\u2014for example, **tsawla utraltsy\u00ecp** \u2018large bush.\u2019\n\n\n\n2. __To express affection or endearment__. Here **\u2013tsy\u00ecp** may or may not be associated with physical smallness. Examples:\n\n\n\n**Za\u2019u f\u00ectseng, ma \u2019itetsy\u00ecp.** \u2018Come here, little daughter.\u2019 (Could be said even to an adult daughter.)\n\n\n\n[Digression: With verbs of motion, **ne** can be optionally omitted if the destination comes after the verb. So you can say **Po zola\u2019u f\u00ectsengne** or **Po zola\u2019u f\u00ectseng**. But ***Po f\u00ectseng zola\u2019u** is ungrammatical; it has to be **Po f\u00ectsengne** (or **ne f\u00ectseng**) **zola\u2019u.**]\n\n\n\n**Kempe si nga, ma sa\u2019nutsy\u00ecp?** \u2018What are you doing, little mommy?\u2019 (This would not be said to an actual mother, which would be disrespectful, but rather to a young girl, in endearing anticipation of her becoming a mother.)\n\n\n\n**Kamtsy\u00ecp\u00ecl wutsot yerom. \u2018Little Kamun is having dinner.\u2019 **(Kamun might be a little boy, but he might also be a huge adult Na\u2019vi, in which case **\u2013tsy\u00ecp** is ironic and/or affectionate. Note that when **\u2013tsy\u00ecp **is added to a proper name of more than one syllable, the name is often shortened. The full form, in this case **Kamuntsy\u00ecp**, can also be used.)\n\n\n\n**Ngatsy\u00ecp yawne lu oer.** \u2018I love you, little one.\u2019 (Could be said to any loved one, not only to a young child.)\n\n\n\n**Ngari tswintsy\u00ecp sevin n\u00ectxan lu nang!** \u2018What a pretty little queue you have!\u2019 (**tswin **\u2018queue.\u2019 Note that in sentences like this that involve possession, especially \u201cinalienable possession, the **\u2013ri** form (i.e. the topic marker) is slightly more idiomatic than the possessive pronoun, although both are correct. So **\u201cNgey\u00e4 tswintsy\u00ecp** . . .\u201d is fine, although many Na\u2019vi would prefer to say \u201c**Ngari .** . .\u201d)\n\n\n\n3. __To express disparagement or insult__.\n\n\n\n**F\u00ectaronyutsy\u00ecp ke tsun ke\u2019ut stiv\u00e4\u2019n\u00ec**. \u2018This (worthless) little hunter can\u2019t catch anything.\u2019\n\n\n\n**Ngatsy\u00ecp\u00ecl new peut ta oe? **\u2018What does little you want from me?\u2019 (Note that while **ngatsy\u00ecp** was endearing in the previous example, here it\u2019s disparaging. To tell which is which, you need to consider the context, facial expressions, and body language.)\n\n\n\n**Nga n\u00ecawnomum to oetsy\u00ecp lu txur n\u00ectxan. \u2018**As everyone knows, you\u2019re a lot stronger than little old me.\u2019 (Here **\u2013tsy\u00ecp** is used ironically, for mock self-deprecation. Also, **oetsy\u00ecp** is pronounced WE.tsy\u00ecp.)\n\n\n\nBe careful not to confuse **\u2013vi** and **\u2013tsy\u00ecp**: there are similarities, but they\u2019re not the same. Rather than indicating a small version of the original, the **\u2013vi** suffix is used for a part or division of a whole, or a \u201clittle bit of\u201d something. So **atanvi** \u2018ray\u2019 is a bit of **atan**, light; **txepvi **\u2018spark\u2019 is a bit of **txep** \u2018fire\u2019 (**txeptsy\u00ecp** would possibly be a \u2018dear or cute little fire\u2019); **l\u00ec\u2019fyavi** \u2018linguistic expression (word, phrase, sentence)\u2019 is a bit of **l\u00ec\u2019fya** \u2018language.\u2019 Also, **-vi** is not as freely productive as **\u2013tsy\u00ecp**. This is worth some explanation.\n\n\n\nTake the English suffix \u2013er that\u2019s added to verbs to get the \u201cagent\u201d\u2014the one who is doing the verb: eater=one who eats, hunter=one who hunts, etc. You can add \u2013er to most verbs, and you\u2019ll get another word whose meaning is predictable. So even if you don\u2019t know what it means to burble, you do know that that a burbler is one who burbles. (This doesn\u2019t always work: people who type or cycle are better called typists and cyclists than typers and cyclers. But it works more often than not.) We say that the \u2013er suffix is **productive**.\n\n\nIn contrast, adding the suffix \u2013ment to a verb to get a related noun is not freely productive. From govern we get government, which is a body that governs. From replace we get replacement, but that\u2019s not a body that replaces\u2014it\u2019s the thing replaced. And there\u2019s no *eatment, *huntment, *feelment, etc. (I\u2019m not sure about burblement.) So the  \u2013ment suffix is not productive: we can\u2019t add it freely to verbs, and when we can, the meaning isn\u2019t necessarily clear. Words with \u2013ment have to be learned individually, and so they\u2019re listed in the dictionary.\n\n\nSimilar things are true in Na\u2019vi. Certain affixes (prefixes, infixes, and suffixes) are productive, others not. For example, almost all the verb infixes (-**er-, -ol-, -iv-, -ay-, -\u00ecm-,** etc.) are productive: you can use them with any verb at all, as long as you know the right place to insert them. The agentive suffix **\u2013yu** is also freely productive. On the other hand, the prefix **t\u00ec-**, which forms nouns out of verbs, adjectives, and other nouns, is not freely productive. You can\u2019t come up with your own **t\u00ec-** words\u2014you need to make sure they\u2019re in the dictionary. And when they are, the meanings won\u2019t always be predictable: **t\u00ecftang** means \u2018stopping,\u2019 but **t\u00ecrol** doesn\u2019t mean \u2018singing\u2019 but rather \u2018song.\u2019 (Note that when you want to talk **about** an action\u2014as in \u201cSwimming is great exercise\u201d\u2014you can always use the Na\u2019vi gerund, which is a two-affix form: use the **t\u00ec-** prefix **along with** the **\u2013us-** infix: **t\u00ecyusom** \u2018eating,\u2019 **t\u00ectusaron** \u2018hunting,\u2019 etc., and that process **is** productive. Example: **T\u00eckusar eltur t\u00ectxen si**. \u2018Teaching is interesting.\u2019)\n\n\n\nFinally, some affixes are midway on the productivity scale. The adverb-former **n\u00ec-** is productive when used with adjectives: **n\u00ecngay** \u2018truly,\u2019 **n\u00ecwin** \u2018fast,\u2019 **n\u00ecsti** \u2018angrily,\u2019 **n\u00ecftue **\u2018easily,\u2019 etc. But it\u2019s sometimes also used with other parts of speech\u2014**n\u00ectut** \u2018continually,\u2019 **n\u00ec\u2019eyng** \u2018in response,\u2019 **n\u00ec\u2019awtu** \u2018alone\u2019\u2014and these words have to be learned as separate lexical items; you can\u2019t take them as patterns on which to base new forms.\n\n\n\nAnd with that I\u2019ll just say: **S\u00eclpey oe, ayngari f\u00ect\u00ecp\u00e4ngkxotsy\u00ecp eltur t\u00ectxen silvi.**\n\n\n\n**\n\nSome Conversational Expressions\n**\n\n\nHere are some miscellaneous expressions you might find useful in conversation.\n\n\n1. __Responding to thanks__\n\n\nDepending on the situation, there are different ways to respond to someone who thanks you for something:\n\n\n2. __Responding to a compliment__\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not customary to say **irayo** in response to a compliment. Instead, there are three common responses:\n\n\n\n3. __Congratulating someone__\n\n\n\nUpon hearing about someone\u2019s good fortune, the Na\u2019vi say **Seykxel s\u00ec nitram!** Literally: Strong and happy! That is, may you derive strength and happiness from this event, accomplishment, etc. Note: **\nsey__kxel__\n** and **txur** are both adjectives meaning \u2018strong,\u2019 but they aren\u2019t the same: **txur** refers to physical strength, **seykxel** to inner strength, a quiet feeling of confidence in one\u2019s own capability.

As you know, transitive verbs are the ones that take objects; with these, the subject is in the agentive or ergative case (L-family endings) and the object is in the objective or patientive case (T-family endings): **Oel ngati kameie**. Intransitive verbs don\u2019t take objects, and their subjects are unmarked: **Po herahaw.**\n\n\nFor verbs of more than one syllable, I\u2019ve used the excellent notation I discovered on learnnavi.org (\u25cf) to indicate where the first- and second-position infixes are inserted.\n\n\n**\n__Usage Notes__\n**\n\n\n\n\u2019A\u2019AW\nUsed only with countable nouns (people, plants, rocks, days, ideas, . . . ), not with uncountables (water, air, time, patience, anger, . . . ). Like numbers, **\u2019a\u2019aw** is used with the **singular** of the noun. Example:\n\n\n\n**Lu poru \u2019a\u2019awa \u2019eylan.** OR **Lu poru \u2019eylan a\u2019a\u2019aw**. \u2018He has several friends.\u2019\n\n\n(These are good sentences for practicing your glottal stops!)\n\n\nDon\u2019t confuse **\u2019a\u2019aw** \u2018several, a few\u2019 with **hol** \u2018(only a) few, not many\u2019:\n\n\n\n**Oel tse\u2019a \u2019a\u2019awa tutet**. \u2018I see several people.\u2019\n\n\n\n**Oel tse\u2019a hola tutet. **\u2018I see only a few people**.\u2019**\n\n\n\nNote that **pxay** \u2018many\u2019 is exceptional in that it can be used with either singular or plural nouns: **pxaya tute** and **pxaya sute** are both allowable.

Example:\n\n\n\n**Tskalepit oel tol\u00ecng oey\u00e4 tsmukanur alu \u00ccstaw**. \u2018I gave the crossbow to my brother Istaw.\u2019\n\n\n\nYou can also use **alu** conversationally as an \u201cexplainer,\u201d in the sense of \u201cthat is to say\u201d or \u201cin other words\u201d:\n\n\n\n**Txoa livu, yawne lu oer Sorewn . . . alu . . . ke tsun oeng muntxa slivu**. \u2018Sorry, but I love Sorewn . . . in other words, you and I cannot marry.\u2019\n\n\n\nHAWNGKRR and YE\u2019KRR\nThese are adverbs, not adjectives:\n\n\n\n**Hawngkrr r\u00e4\u2019\u00e4 ziva\u2019u!** \u2018Don\u2019t come late!\u2019\n\n\n\nIf you need the adjectives, they\u2019re **lehawngkrr** and **leye\u2019krr**: **t\u00ecp\u00e4hem leye\u2019krr** \u2018an early arrival\u2019\n\n\n\nHEK\nThis verb conveys the idea of something appearing odd, strange, unexpected, or surprising.\n\n\n\n**Ngey\u00e4 s\u00e4fp\u00ecl Sawtuteteri heiek oer n\u00ectxan**. \u2018Your idea about the Sky People is very interesting to me (because it seems unusual).\u2019 OR \u2018I&#8217;m very curious (and delighted) about your idea regarding the Sky People.\u2019\n\n\n\nNote that **n\u00echek** is a sentence adverbial only, not a manner adverbial . . . **alu** . . . **n\u00echek** is \u2018strangely\u2019 in the sense of the speaker making a comment about the situation:\n\n\n\n**N\u00echek fo n\u00ecNa\u2019vi plltxe**. \u2018Strangely, they speak Na\u2019vi.\u2019\n\n\n\nIf on the other hand you want to say that someone does something in a strange manner, you\u2019d use **n\u00ecfya\u2019o a hek**, \u2018in a way that\u2019s strange\u2019:\n\n\n\n**Fo n\u00ecNa\u2019vi plltxe n\u00ecfya\u2019o a hek**. \u2018They speak Na\u2019vi strangely.\u2019\n\n\n\nNote the difference between the verb **hek** and the adjective **stxong** \u2018strange, unfamiliar, unknown.\u2019 **Hek** is used for something odd, unexpected, or puzzling but not necessarily bad. **Stxong** is stronger and usually has a negative connotation: it\u2019s applied to something previously unknown or unimagined that appears threatening or dangerous. Example:\n\n\n\n**Larmu tsatsamsiyuhu t\u00ecvawm a lu stxong ayoer**. \u2018That warrior carried with him a darkness unknown to us.\u2019\n\n\n\nKI\nDon\u2019t confuse **sl\u00e4** and **ki**. **Ki** is \u2018but\u2019 in the sense of \u2018not A but (rather) B.\u2019 (Speakers of German will see the parallel with **aber** vs. **sondern**.) **Ke** and **ki** form a pair:\n\n\n\n**Nga plltxe ke n\u00ecfyeyntu ki n\u00ec\u2019eveng**. \u2018You speak not like an adult but a child.\u2019\n\n\n\nNETR\u00ccP\nSee SYAYVI.\n\n\n\nRENG and TXUKX\nThese words primarily refer to physical depth: **kilvan areng**, **kilvan atxukx**. They can\u2019t be applied to people: ***tute areng** makes no sense. But as in many languages, they are sometimes applied metaphorically to thoughts, ideas, analyses, etc.: e.g. **ays\u00e4fp\u00ecl atxukx** \u2018deep thoughts.\u2019\n\n\n\nROLUN\n**Rolun** and **tolel** are conversational exclamations used for \u201cEureka!\u201d moments. The difference is that **Rolun!** means you\u2019ve found something, e.g. a lost object, the answer to a question, the solution to a problem, whereas **Tolel!** means you\u2019ve had a flash of insight and now you \u201cget it\u201d\u2014you\u2019ve received knowledge or understanding.\n\n\n\nSMAR\nThis word appears in a famous Na\u2019vi proverb:\n\n\n\n**\u00c4tx\u00e4le si palulukanur tsn\u00ec smarit livonu**. \u2018Ask a thanator to release its prey.\u2019 Refers to a futile gesture, an attempt to achieve something that might be desirable but will clearly not happen. In conversation it\u2019s usually shortened to **\u00c4tx\u00e4le pa(lu)lukanur**. (In fast speech, **palulukan** tends to simplify to **palukan**, which is acceptable in colloquial style.)\n\n\n\nSUNU\nThis important verb, which works similarly to Spanish **gustar**, is used to say you like something:\n\n\n\n**Sunu oeru teylu.** \u2018I like teylu.\u2019 (**Teylu sunu oeru** is also possible.)\n\n\n\n**Sunu** and **prrte\u2019 lu** both mean that the speaker enjoys something. While **sunu** is \u2018like\u2019 in the general sense, **prrte\u2019 lu** is generally deeper and more heartfelt; it\u2019s often used in social situations, translating to \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure . . .\u201d:\n\n\n\n**Furia tsolun oe ngahu piv\u00e4ngkxo, oeru prrte\u2019 lu n\u00ecngay**. \u2018It was really a pleasure to be able to speak with you.\u2019\n\n\n\n[Digression: The **prrte\u2019** construction can be a bit confusing. **Prrte\u2019** is an adjective meaning \u2018pleasurable,\u2019 so an alternate way of saying the previous sentence is:\n\n\n\n**Fwa **[**f\u00ec\u2019u a**]** tsolun oe ngahu piv\u00e4ngkxo oeru prrte\u2019 lu n\u00ecngay. **Literally: \u2018The fact that I was able to speak with you is really pleasurable to me.\u2019\n\n\n\nThe structure of the original sentences with **furia** is more like: \u2018As for the fact that I was able to speak with you, (it) is really pleasurable to me.\u2019 Either structure is acceptable.]\n\n\n\n**Mowan **implies physical or sensual pleasure, and often has a sexual connotation:\n\n\n\n**Plltxe fko san ngaru lu mowan Txilte ulte poru nga**. \u2018I hear you like Txilte and vice versa.\u2019\n\n\n\n**Mowan** is also used slangily as a general term for \u2018like\u2019:\n\n\n\n**T\u00ectusaron mowan lu oer n\u00ecngay**. \u2018Hunting really turns me on.\u2019\n\n\n\nSYAYVI\n**Syay** by itself means \u2018fate\u2019 in the sense of one\u2019s destiny\u2014the arc of one\u2019s life:\n\n\n\n**Tsakrr syay ayngey\u00e4, syay olo\u2019\u00e4 oey\u00e4 layu teng. **\u2018Then you will suffer the same fate as my clan.\u2019\n\n\n\n**Syayvi** refers to a \u201clittle piece of fate\u201d\u2014that is, chance or luck in a particular situation. For example, the expression for \u2018Good luck!\u2019 is **Etr\u00ecpa syayvi!**\n\n\n\nNote that **n\u00ecsyayvi** means \u2018by chance, by coincidence, as luck would have it\u2019\u2014it does **not** mean \u2018luckily.\u2019 For that you use **netr\u00ecp**.\n\n\n\nTOLEL\nSee ROLUN.\n\n\n\nTXUKX\nSee RENG.\n\n\n\nZO\nThis stative verb indicates that \u201call is well\u201d with the subject\u2014something or someone is functioning correctly. Both **zo** and **lu fpom** can mean the subject is well, but there\u2019s a difference in usage. **Fpom** is a noun meaning \u2018well-being, peace, happiness.\u2019 **Zo** is a verb with a narrower scope, usually implying physical health. So contrast these two questions:\n\n\n\n**Ngaru lu fpom srak?** \u2018Are you well?\u2019 (Are you experiencing a general sense of happiness and well-being?)\n\n\n\n**Nga zo srak?** \u2018Are you well?\u2019 (Have you recovered from your illness? Are you OK after that nasty fall?)\n\n\n\nExamples of the derivative verbs **zoslu** and **zeyko**:\n\n\n\n**Oeri n\u00ec\u2019i\u2019a tsyokx zoslolu.** \u2018My hand is finally healed.\u2019\n\n\n\n**Eywal zeykivo ngat n\u00ecwin**. \u2018May Eywa heal you quickly.\u2019\n\n\n\n**Frawzo** is from **fra\u2019u** + **zo**. Compounds with **\u2019u** often lose the glottal stop. Here the resulting **au **combination has changed into a diphthong as well.\n\n\n\nEdit 17 July&#8211;Two errors corrected: **n\u00echek** classed as ADV; glottal stop added to **\nftx\u00ecv\u00e4**\u2019.**\n**\n\n\n", "new vocabulary": [], "tags": ["vocabulary", "grammar", "writing", "conversation", "colloquial", "discussion"]}, "T\u00ecng Mikyun fte Tslivam: Listening Comprehension #1": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2010/07/ting-mikyun-fte-tslivam-listening-comprehension-1-3/", "content": "Here\u2019s a little two-minute listening comprehension exercise for intermediate and advanced learners that I hope will be fun.\n\nYou can use it any way you like, but I\u2019d suggest the following:\n\nFirst, review the recent vocabulary.

Here\u2019s their list:\n\n\n**( \u2019 ) t\u00ecFtang, A, AW, AY, \u00c4, E, EW, EY, F\u00e4, H\u00e4, I, \u00cc,**\n\n\n\n**KeK, KxeKx, LeL, \u2019Ll, MeM, NeN, NgeNg, O, PeP, PxePx,**\n\n\n\n**ReR, \u2019Rr, S\u00e4, TeT, TxeTx, Ts\u00e4, U, V\u00e4, W\u00e4, Y\u00e4, Z\u00e4**\n\n\n\nAs you see, in reciting this alphabet you pronounce the vowels, pseudo-vowels, and diphthongs exactly as they sound. The consonants, though, are interesting: there\u2019s a distinction between those that can\u2019t come at the end of a syllable and those that can. For the former group, you just add the vowel \u00e4 to get the name of the consonant: **F\u00e4**, **H\u00e4**, **S\u00e4**, etc. For the latter group, you use the vowel e but you also put the consonant at the end of the name, keeping it capitalized: **KeK**, **KxeKx**, **Lel**, **MeM**, etc. I really like how the names of these sounds reflect something about how they\u2019re used. (The exception is the first letter of the alphabet, the glottal stop; if it followed the rule, its name would be **\u2019e\u2019**, but that might be a challenge to distinguish from **E**. Instead, the word **t\u00ecFtang**, meaning \u201cstop,\u201d is used.)\n\n\n\nAs for the ordering, which largely parallels that of Roman-based alphabets on Earth, Prrton writes: \u201cThe order is sadly determined by \u2018Rrtan \u2018informatics&#8217; conventions that we can\u2019t do much about. This is how Excel et all sort (with the exception of our having **Txetx** come before **Ts\u00e4**). We\u2019ll just have to manually compensate for that when required.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow do you ask how a word is spelled? \u201cSpelling\u201d is **pamrelfya**. (Recall that \u201cwriting\u201d is **pamrel**.)\n\n\nSo, from the most formal way to the most colloquial:\n\nExample:\n\n\n**&#8211;L\u00ec\u2019uri alu tskxe pamrel fyape?** \u2018How do you spell the word **tskxe**?\u2019\n\n\n\n&#8211;**Pamrelfya lu na Ts\u00e4, KxeKx, E**. \u2018It\u2019s spelled ts, kx, e.\u2019 (Literally: (Its) spelling is like ts,\nkx, e.)\n\n\n\nNote that this Na\u2019vi alphabet reflects a phonemic analysis of the language: for example, the word **tskxe** has 3 phonemes\u2014not 5!\u2014which is paralleled in giving the spelling. And if a Pandoran linguist invented an indigenous alphabetical writing system for Na\u2019vi, it would take only 3 distinct symbols to write that word.\n\n\n", "new vocabulary": [], "tags": ["colloquial", "formal", "discussion"]}, "Mipa ayopin, mipa ayl\u00ec\u2019u\u2013New colors, new words": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2010/08/mipa-ayopin-mipa-ayliu-new-colors-new-words/", "content": "In honor of the re-release of **Unilt\u00ecrantokx** tonight, here\u2019s Part 1 of the Na\u2019vi color system along with a bit of new vocabulary.\n\n\n\n**Colors**\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://naviteri.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Ayopin-akawnenong.jpg\">\n<img title=\"Ayopin akawnenong\" src=\"Naviteri/Ayopin-akawnenong.jpg\" alt=\"*\" />\n</a>\n\n\nAs the graphic indicates, Na\u2019vi has 9 basic or primitive color terms:\n\n\nTUN: covers the red-to-orange part of the spectrum\nRIM: yellow\nEAN: green to blue\n\u2019OM: violet to purple to magenta\nLAYON: black\nTEYR: white\nVAWM: deep dark colors including browns\nNEYN: light colors\u2014\u201cshades of white\u201d\nNGUL: gray or drab\n\n\nTo further subdivide the spectrum and name colors more specifically, Na\u2019vi has 3 distinct mechanisms:\n\n\n(1)    **Na**-constructions\n(2)    Adverbial modification with **n\u00ec-**\n(3)    Compounding\n\n\nHere I\u2019ll discuss the first of these, which is the productive mechanism, and leave the other two for another time.\n\n\nBefore anything else, note that these color terms are regular adjectives&#8211;not nouns, not stative verbs. To form color nouns, just add** -pin**. So for example:\n\n\n\n**F\u00ecsyulang lu rim**. \u2018This flower is yellow.\u2019\n**F\u00ecsyulang arim lu h\u00ec&#8217;i frato**. \u2018This yellow flower is the smallest of all.\u2019\n**Ke sunu oeru rimpin**. \u2018I don\u2019t like the color yellow.\u2019\n\n\n\nNote that when the basic color term ends in -n, the n is pronounced m before the p of **pin**. (Linguists would call that an instance of regressive nasal assimilation.) And the spelling changes to reflect that. So we have **\n__tum__pin\n**, **\n__e__ampin\n**, **\n__neym__pin\n**, **la**__\n**yom**\n__**pin**. This happens in other places in Na\u2019vi (for example: **txampay** \u2018sea, ocean\u2019, a compound of **txan** \u2018much\u2019 + **pay** \u2018water\u2019) and of course in \u2019Rrtan languages as well (cf. \u2018indelicate,\u2019 \u2018inadequate,\u2019 \u2018inhuman,\u2019 \u2018interminable,\u2019 \u2018insufficient,\u2019 etc. but \u2018impatient,\u2019 \u2018imperfect,\u2019 and so on).\n\n\n\nFor more specific colors, Na\u2019vi uses **na**-constructions (**na** = like, as) for comparison to the colors of well-known objects in the environment. For example, to specify that the kind of **ean** you mean is the blue color of Na\u2019vi skin, you say **ean na ta\u2019leng** or **ta\u2019lengna ean**, \u2018skin-color blue.\u2019 (Note that \u201cmodifying **a\u201d** is not normally used between **na **and the basic color term.)\n\n\n\nThe syntax is straightforward. For ease of reading, hyphens are inserted when **na**-colors are used attributively (before or after a noun). Examples:\n\n\n\n**F\u00ecsyulang lu ean na ta\u2019leng.** OR **F\u00ecsyulang lu ta\u2019lengna ean**. \u2018This flower is skin-blue.\u2019\n\n\nTo say \u2018This skin-blue flower is very beautiful,\u2019 you have 4 choices:\n\n\n1. **F\u00ecsyulang aean-na-ta\u2019leng lor lu n\u00ectxan.**\n2. **F\u00ecsyulang ata\u2019lengna-ean lor lu n\u00ectxan.**\n3. **Ean-na-ta\u2019lenga f\u00ecsyulang lor lu n\u00ectxan.**\n4. **Ta\u2019lengna-eana f\u00ecsyulang lor lu n\u00ectxan**.\n\n\n\nThe **na-** process for colors is productive&#8211;that is, Na\u2019vi speakers are free to come up with these comparisons on their own, as long as there\u2019s good reason to expect that the listener will understand the comparison and be able to visualize the color. So, for example, if the particular shade of **ean** you have in mind is the color of the chin of a Great Leonopteryx, you can refer to it as **ean na tsuks\u00ecm toruk\u00e4**. Here are some more examples:\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://naviteri.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/tikenong-hu-tsaliu-alu-na.jpg\">\n<img title=\"tikenong-hu-tsaliu-alu-na\" src=\"Naviteri/tikenong-hu-tsaliu-alu-na.jpg\" alt=\"*\" />\n</a>\u00ba1: **vawm na nikre**&#8211;the dark color of Na&#8217;vi hair\n\u00ba2: \u2019**om na mikyun**&#8211;the purplish color on the inside of a Na\u2019vi ear\n\u00ba3: **layon** Note that **layon** and **teyr** are not modifiable except in poetry.\n**Layon** is solid black, the total absence of color; **teyr** is pure white.\n\u00ba4: **rim na nari** (Although there are lots of different kinds of eyes on Pandora, in the\nabsence of further specification it\u2019s understand here that **nari** means **nari leNa\u2019vi**.)\n\u00ba5: **ean na ta\u2019leng**&#8211;skin-blue\n\u00ba6: **ean na pil**&#8211;facial-stripe blue\n\u00ba7: **neyn na tx\u00e4rem**&#8211;the light color of bone\n\u00ba10: **tun na eyktan**&#8211;\u201cleader red,\u201d the reddish color that distinguishes the dress of Na\u2019vi leaders\n\u00ba11: **ean na r\u00eck**&#8211;leaf-green (as on earth, not all leaves are green, but most are. **Ean na r\u00eck **and **ean na ta\u2019leng** are the most common ways to distinguish green from blue.)\n\u00ba12: **neyn na yapay**&#8211;the light, nondescript color of mist or fog\n\u00ba13: **vawm na uk**&#8211;dark-shadow color\n\u00ba14: **ngul na tskxe**&#8211;the drab color of stone\n\n\n\nAs you might expect, some **na**-comparisons are idiosyncratic while others are common and universal. Some of the very common ones have developed one-word forms that are part of the standard lexicon. For example:\n\n\n\n**\nta\u2019lengna ean &gt; __ta\u2019__lengean\n**\n\n\n\n**\nr\u00eckna ean &gt; __r\u00eck__ean\n**\n\n\n\n**\nkllna vawm &gt; __kll__vawm\n** \u2018brown\u2019\n\n\nI&#8217;ll talk more about these&#8211;and the other color-forming mechanisms&#8211;in a later post.\n\n\nThanks to everyone who provided me with references and links to the fascinating scholarly work on color systems in various Terran languages.

There\u2019s no rhyme or reason for these right now as opposed to others, except that some of them will help us talk about **Avatar** more easily:\n\n\n\nNote: **tor **and **syen **both mean \u2018last,\u2019 and there\u2019s some overlap. The difference is that **syen** usually refers to the last in series: **t\u00ecpawm asyen**: the last question asked (e.g. Q #5 in a series of 5); **tor** refers to something that will **bring about **finality: **t\u00ecpawm ator**: the ultimate question, the answer to which will end all discussion, debate, or contemplation.****\n\n\n\n**\nTxo mipa Unilt\u00ecrantokxit ayngal ts\u00ecyeve&#8217;a f\u00ectxon fu trray, ma eylan, s\u00eclpey oe tsn\u00ec sivunu ayngaru n\u00ecwotx!\n**\n\n\n", "new vocabulary": [], "tags": ["vocabulary", "grammar", "writing", "discussion"]}, "Kaltx\u00ec ta Kopenhan\u2013Hi from Copenhagen": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2010/09/kaltxi-ta-kopenhan-hi-from-copenhagen/", "content": "**Kaltx\u00ec, ma eylan**.

(Ay)Ngari tut?\n**\n**\n\n\n\nAs you can guess, **\nh\u00ec__txo__\n****a** is a \u201csmall forgiveness,\u201d used routinely where politeness is called for: \u201cpardon me,\u201d \u201cexcuse me,\u201d etc. **Oeru txoa livu** is a more serious apology for something you know you did wrong.\n\n\n\n**M\u00e4kxu** [**\nm\u2022\u2022\u00e4__kxu__\n**] is a transitive verb meaning \u2018interrupt\u2019 or \u2018throw out of harmonious balance\u2019 in the context of an ongoing activity. In English it\u2019s possible to \u2018interrupt\u2019 a person directly, but in Na\u2019vi **m\u00e4kxu** is only used for activities or established conditions, not people. **Pol mol\u00e4kxu ultxati.** \u2018He interrupted the meeting.\u2019 It does not necessarily have a negative connotation even though it evolved from a compound containing the component **kxu,** which in other contexts is clearly \u2018harm.\u2019 In contrast, **hultstxem** [h\u2022ul__tstx\u2022em__] is a transitive verb meaning \u2018hinder\u2019 or \u2018be an obstacle to.\u2019 Its object can be either an activity or a person, and it usually has a negative connotation. Example: **H\u00ectxoa, ke new oel futa f\u00ect\u00ecp\u00e4ngkxot ayngey\u00e4 hivultstxem, sl\u00e4 tsun miv\u00e4kxu h\u00eckrr n\u00ec\u2019aw srak?** \u2018Excuse me. I don\u2019t want to derail your chat, but can I interrupt for just a moment?\u2019\n\n\n\nBy the way, notice that to say you come **from** somewhere, you use **ftu**, not **ta**. **Ftu** pairs with **ne**: they indicate directions from and to a place respectively.\n\n\n\n10. Hi. You\u2019re Sorewn, right? I\u2019m Tsenu. Sister Rini over there suggested that I introduce myself. She said you\u2019re really into cooking and that we might share that in common.\n**\n**Kaltx\u00ec. Nga lu Sorewn, kefyak? Oer syaw fko Tsenu. Tsatsmukel alu Rini molok futa oe ngar muw\u00e4piv\u00ecntxu.

So in this case it\u2019s **Tsatsmukel alu Rini**, not ***Tsatsmukel alu Rinil**.\n\n\n\nNext are two useful transitive verbs, **mok** \u2018suggest\u2019 and** muw\u00ecntxu **[**\nmuw\u2022\u00ecn__tx\u2022u__\n**] \u2018introduce\u2019 or \u2018present.\u2019 This latter word can be used not only for introducing a person but also for presenting an idea, report, analysis, etc. Here it has the reflexive infix for \u2018introduce oneself.\u2019 Remember, though, that the most usual way to introduce another person omits the verb entirely. See 2 and 3 above.\n\n\n\nThe transitive verb **\n__kan__\u2019\u00ecn\n** [**\n__k\u2022an__\u2019\u2022\u00ecn\n**] means \u2018focus on, specialize in, be particularly interested in.\u2019 Example: **Entul kan\u2019\u00ecn t\u00ecwusemit**. \u2018Entu specializes in fighting\u2019\u2014that is, fighting is a major interest of his or focus of his activity.\n\n\n\nThe expression for \u2018share an interest in common\u2019 is **za\u2019u n\u00ec\u2019eng**, literally, \u2018come in a level or equal manner.\u2019 Example: **T\u00ecrusol za\u2019u ne fo n\u00ec\u2019eng**. \u2018They share an interest in singing.\u2019 (Literally, \u2018Singing comes to them equally.\u2019)\n\n\n\nFinally, note how **san** works in the last sentence. (**S\u00eck** is not required here, since the utterance ends with the quoted material.) Tsenu needs to quote what Rini said exactly, so a less natural but more literal translation would be, \u2018She said, \u201cSorewn is really into cooking, and perhaps the two of you might share that matter in common.\u201d\u2019 That explains the appearance of **menga** \u2018the two of you\u2019 where you might be tempted to use **oeng** \u2018you and I.\u2019\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-size: small;\">\nEdit 27 Sept: **Sorewn** corrected to **Sorewn\u00ecl** in last sentence of #10. **Irayo, ma Plumps!**\n__\n\n\n", "new vocabulary": [], "tags": ["grammar", "conversation", "formal", "discussion"]}, "Getting to Know You, Part 2": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2010/09/getting-to-know-you-part-2/", "content": "This post continues the conversational theme. Here we\u2019re beyond the introduction stage and beginning to find out things about the person we\u2019re speaking with. Thanks again to Prrton for his great work on this.\n\nFirst, some useful expressions to help out generally in oral communication:\n\n\n**WHEN YOU\u2019RE STUCK OR DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND**\n\n\n\n11.  Sorry, I didn\u2019t get that. Could you repeat it, please?\n**\n**H\u00ectxoa, ke tslolam. Rutxe liveyn.**\n**\n\n\n\nThe transitive verb **leyn** means \u2018repeat, do again.\u2019 It\u2019s applicable to any action or activity. For example, a mother can say to a naughty child who\u2019s just been chastised for a misdeed, **R\u00e4\u2019\u00e4 liveyn!** \u2018Don\u2019t do that again!\u2019 In the context of a conversation, it\u2019s understood that the action in question is speaking, so you\u2019re asking the speaker to repeat the last thing he/she said.\n\n\nFor added politeness:\n\n\n12.  I didn\u2019t quite understand. OR I may not have understood.\n**\n**\nKe tslola__tsam__.\n**\n**\n\n\nThe response on the part of the repeater is:\n\n\n13.  Sure. (Gladly. With pleasure.) What I said was . . .\n**\n**N\u00ecprrte\u2019. Poltxe san . . .**\n**\n\n\nIf you need clarification:\n\n\n14.  Could you make that a bit clearer? Could you explain that further?\n**\n**Tsun nga law sivi n\u00ec\u2019it srak?**\n**\n\n\nTo ask the meaning of something specific:\n\n\n15.  What does X mean?\n**\n**\nTsa__l\u00ec__\u2019uri alu X, ral lu \u2019upe?\n**\n**\n\n\n\nThis actually means, of course, \u2018What does the word X mean?\u2019 If it\u2019s not a word but a phrase you\u2019re after, substitute **\ntsa__l\u00ec__\u2019fyaviri\n** for **\ntsa__l\u00ec__\u2019uri\n**.\n\n\nA shorter and highly colloquial version of 15 is acceptable in informal circumstances:\n\n\n16.  What does X mean?\n**\n**\nX-(\u00ec)ri pe__ral__?\n**\n**\n\n\n\nFinally, what happens if you\u2019re groping for a word or expression that\u2019s not there, and no circumlocution comes to mind? Assuming you share another language with your audience, rather than having communication come to a screeching halt it\u2019s better to insert the needed word or expression in the language you both know into the Na\u2019vi sentence, preceded by **n\u00ec\u2019\u00ccngl\u00ecs\u00ec**, **n\u00ecFranse**, **n\u00ecToitsye**, **n\u00ecTsyungwen**, etc. E.g., **Sunu oeru** **n\u00ec\u2019\u00ccngl\u00ecs\u00ec **basketball** n\u00ectxan. **(Of course, if you were Na&#8217;vi, you&#8217;d be more likely to pronounce &#8220;basketball&#8221; something like **p\u00e4sketpol**, so that would be fine in this context as well.)\n\n\n\n**\n\nINITIAL CONVERSATIONS\n**\n\n\n\n17.  Tell me a bit more about yourself.\n**\n**Nga l\u00e4pivawk n\u00ec\u2019it n\u00ec\u2019ul ko.**\n**\n\n\n\n**\n** **\n**\n\n\n\n18.  Tell me all about yourself.\n**\n**Nga l\u00e4pivawk n\u00ecno ko.**\n**\n\n\n\nThe adverb **\nn\u00ec__no__\n** means \u2018in detail, expansively, thoroughly.\u2019 The root on which it\u2019s based, **no**, conveys the idea of fine detail. It\u2019s not used by itself in modern Na\u2019vi, but certain forms derived from it are found in the lexicon. Examples:\n\n\n\nThe polite expression for \u201cmay I ask\u201d is **\n\u00c4__tx\u00e4__le si oe pivawm\n**, literally \u2018I request to ask.\u2019 (In an early version of the Avatar screenplay, the newly-arrived Norm is talking to a Pandoran for the first time in his overly formal, stilted Na\u2019vi, and says: **\u00c4tx\u00e4le suyi ohe pivawm, peolo\u2019 luyu pum ngengey\u00e4?** \u2018May I ask what tribe you belong to?\u2019)\n\n\n\n19.  May I ask who the people in your family are?\n**\n**\u00c4tx\u00e4le si oe pivawm, ngari soai\u00e4 ayhapx\u00ectu lu supe?**\n**\n\n\n\nA couple of things to note here: First, the genitive of **soaia** \u2018family\u2019 is irregular: **soai\u00e4** (not ***soaiay\u00e4**). Also, **supe** is \u2018who (pl.)\u2019\u2014i.e., \u2018what people\u2019 as opposed to \u2018what person.\u2019\n\n\nTo ask someone\u2019s age:\n\n\n20.  How old you are?\n**\n**Ngari solalew polpxaya z\u00ecs\u00ect? **OR** Ngari solalew z\u00ecs\u00ect apolpxay?**\n**\n\n\n\nLiterally, this is: \u2018As for you, how many years have passed?\u2019 Note that **\npol__pxay__\n**, \u2018how many,\u2019 behaves like an ordinary adjective.\n\n\nIn conversation, the age question may be shortened in several ways. The following are all possible, with decreasing formality as you move down the list:\n\n\nAs you see, if **z\u00ecs\u00ect** will be understood from the context, it can be omitted. Also, in quick, casual speech, **solalew** reduces to **solew**, just as **palulukan** reduces to **palukan**. These reduced forms, however, are not used in written Na\u2019vi except when you want to reproduce the effect of casual speech. (Compare \u201cgoing to\u201d vs. \u201cgonna\u201d in English.)\n\n\nTo answer an age question:\n\n\n21.  I\u2019m 24 years old.\n**\n**Oeri solalew z\u00ecs\u00ect apxevol.**\n**\n\n\nShorter, more colloquial versions:\n\n\n22.  Where are you from?\n**\n**\nNga z(ol)a\u2019u ftu pe__seng__ / ftu __tseng__pe / pe__seng__eftu / __tseng__peftu ?\n**\n**\n\n\n\nThe choice between **za\u2019u** and **zola\u2019u** depends on the context. **Zola\u2019u** is correct in all cases. However, if the question is a general one\u2014\u201cWhere\u2019s your hometown?\u201d\u2014then **za\u2019u** is sufficient. But if the intention is \u201cWhere have you come from (to attend this gathering)?\u201d then **zola\u2019u** is required.\n\n\n\n23.  I was born in a town near the ocean, but I now live in Hometree.\n**\n**Oe \u2019olongokx m\u00ec sray a txampay\u00ecri sim, sl\u00e4 set kelku si m\u00ec Helutral.**\n**\n\n\n\nThe intransitive verb **\u2019ongokx** [__\u2019\u2022ong__\u2022okx] means \u2018be born.\u2019 It\u2019s a compound of **\u2019ong** \u2018unfold, blossom\u2019 and **nokx** \u2018give birth to,\u2019 where the internal **ngn** cluster has reduced to **ng**:\n*\u2019ongnokx &gt; \u2019ongokx. (Note also that proper nouns are subject to lenition just like common nouns: **m\u00ec Helutral**.)\n\n\n\nAn example of **nokx** used by itself:\n\n\n\n24.  Mom gave birth to my new sister yesterday.\n**\n**Sa\u2019nok\u00ecl oey\u00e4 tsmuket amip nolokx trram.**\n**\n\n\nTo ask about someone\u2019s occupation or central activity:\n\n\n25.  What is your primary role (in society)?\n**\n**\nNgaru lu pefne__txin__t\u00ecn n\u00ectrrtrr?\n**\n**\n\n\n\n**N\u00ectrrtrr** obviously means \u2018on a daily basis, regularly.\u2019 (Compare **letrrtrr**.) **Pefnetxint\u00ecn**, though, requires some explanation. Its first two morphemes (minimal elements of meaning) are clearly **pe** \u2018what\u2019 and **fne** \u2018kind (of).\u2019 But what about **\n__txin__t\u00ecn\n**? It\u2019s a compound noun derived from the adjective **txin** \u2018main, primary\u2019 and the noun **t\u00ecn**, \u2018activity that keeps one busy.\u2019 So **txint\u00ecn** could be glossed \u2018occupation\u2019 or \u2018primary role in society.\u2019\n\n\nSome possible ways to answer the question:\n\n\n26.  I am a student / hunter / warrior / teacher / cook.\n**\n**Oe lu numeyu / taronyu / tsamsiyu / karyu / \u2019emyu.**\n**\n\n\n\n27.  My central societal occupation is to catch fish.\n**\n**Oey\u00e4 txint\u00ecn lu fwa st\u00e4\u2019n\u00ec fayoangit.**\n**\n\n\n\n28.  I look after the infants.\n**\n**Oel vewng frrnenit.**\n**\n\n\n\nThe transitive verb **vewng** means \u2018look after, take care of, be responsible for.\u2019\n\n\n\n29.  I tend to the refuse.\n**\n**Oel vewng aysngelit.**\n**\n\n\n\n**\n** **\n**\n\n\n\n30.

Nge__nga__ lu __tu__pe / pe__su__?\n**\n**\n\n\n\nThis is one place where the honoric form of the pronoun is standard. **Nga lu tupe?** could be heard as aggressive and challenging; to make it clear the questioner is being friendly, the honorific is used. The response, however, reverts back to the ordinary pronouns: **Oe lu Txew\u00ec**.\n\n\n\nAs in many earth languages (although not English), to ask someone\u2019s name you don\u2019t normally say the literal equivalent of \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d In Na\u2019vi that would be **Ngari tstxo lu pel\u00ec\u2019u?** It\u2019s not wrong, but there\u2019s a more idiomatic way to ask the question:\n\n\n\n32.  What\u2019s your name:\n**\n**Fyape fko syaw ngar?**\n**\n\n\nLiterally, this is, of course, \u201cHow does one call you?\u201d or \u201cHow do they call you?\u201d The answer is:\n\n\n33.  My name is Txew\u00ec.\n**\n**Oeru syaw (fko) Txew\u00ec.**\n**\n\n\nGetting back to age, if someone has asked you how old you are and you\u2019re having trouble calculating it in octal, you can buy a little time with an expression that\u2019s useful in lots of situations:\n\n\n34.  Just a tiny moment. I\u2019m thinking.\n**\n**\u2019Awa swawtsy\u00ecp. Oe fper\u00ecl.**\n**\n\n\n\nIt would be a good idea, though, to have that number pre-calculated, since you don\u2019t want people to think you\u2019re not sure of your age.  <img src=\"Naviteri/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";-)\" /> (Grammar: If you\u2019re wondering why there\u2019s no case marking on **swawtsy\u00ecp**, it\u2019s because the phrase is short for **\u2019Awa swawtsy\u00ecp livu oer** rather than **\u2019Awa swawtsy\u00ecpit t\u00ecng oer.**)\n\n\n\n**\n\nLEISURE TIME\n**\n\n\nI\u2019m indebted to Prrton for the material in this section, which I think is particularly rich.\n\n\n35.

(We already met one of them, **kan\u2019\u00ecn**, in Part 1.) **\u2019\u00ccn** means \u2018be busy, be occupied\u2019 and is neutral with respect to emotional impact.

But it\u2019s frequently omitted in conversation.\n\n\nFinally, to let someone know there\u2019s no rush, that it\u2019s OK to go slowly and take time (not just in speech but in any activity):\n\n\n49.  Take your time; don\u2019t rush. Slow is fine.\n**\nKe zene win s\u00e4pivi. \u2019I__vong__ n\u00eck__\u2019ong__.\n**\n\n\n\nIn conversation, **s\u00e4pivi** is usually pronounced **\nspi__vi__\n**. (The main stress in the sentence, however, is on **win**.) The second sentence is proverbial\u2014literally, \u201cLet it unfold slowly.\u201d\n\n\nA word on initial glottal stops:\n\n\nThe comments were perceptive. It\u2019s when something **precedes** the initial **t\u00ecftang** that you hear it clearly.\n\n\n\nTake **\u2019eylan** \u2018friend\u2019 vs. the short plural **eylan**. If you say the words in isolation, I doubt there\u2019s much of a distinction, if any. But put them in phrases like (1) **oey\u00e4 \u2019eylan** and (2) **oey\u00e4 eylan** and you hear the difference. In (1) there\u2019s a sharp break between the words; in (2) the words flow together smoothly with no break.\n\n\n\n**Sivop n\u00eczawnong, ma aysopyu**.\n\n\n", "new vocabulary": [], "tags": ["conversation"]}, "Catching Up": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2010/12/catching-up/", "content": "**Kaltx\u00ec, ma oey\u00e4 eylan!**\n\n\n\nContrary to rumors that I have fallen off the face of the earth, I\u2019m happy to say I\u2019m alive and well, if a bit damp, here in Los Angeles. My three months of heavy travel\u2014September through November\u2014are now history. The revisions for the fifth edition of the linguistics workbook I\u2019ve co-authored, **Looking at Languages**, which is due out next year, are almost complete. (This edition will include two Na\u2019vi exercises.) And I\u2019m looking forward to returning to my blog and being in closer touch with you all.\n\n\nI thought you might be interested in a few highlights of my travels.\n\n\nSEPTEMBER: Europe\nI spoke in Stockholm at the Bonnier GRID 2010 conference, a two-day event for employees of the multi-national Bonnier Corporation. The theme of the conference, \u201cIt\u2019s all about passion,\u201d fit in well with the development and growth of Na\u2019vi. After a wonderful week in Stockholm during which I met members of the Swedish Na\u2019vi community, John and I headed to Copenhagen for five days and then flew to Paris for another ten.\n\n\n\nOCTOBER: U.S.A.\nThe month kicked off with the now-legendary **Ultxa a m****\u00ec Na\u2019r****\u00ecng**\u2014the Meeting in the Forest, hosted at the beautiful sylvan home of Prrton and Yotsua in northern California. Ever since, I\u2019ve proudly ended my talks about Na\u2019vi with pictures and stories from that event, including an analysis of **Po t****\u00e4peyk****\u00ecyeverkeiup n****\u00ecn****\u00e4****k*** that some of the attendees had come up with. Audiences are always impressed with the creativity and exuberance of the community.\n\n\n\nMy next event was in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where I spoke at the annual Oklahoma Conference in the Humanities and met some great members of the community as well. Then it was off to Rochester, New York for the 45<sup>th</sup> reunion of my undergraduate class at the University of Rochester. I was one of the guest speakers, and the audience was extremely enthusiastic, which was gratifying. (My undergraduate college career was hardly distinguished, yet I was given the royal treatment on my return to campus 45 years later. It\u2019s remarkable what an association with **Avatar** can do!)\n\n\n\nAfter visiting my piano teacher from college days in central New York, I flew back to Los Angeles to take part in a Fox media event promoting the Collector\u2019s Edition of the **Avatar** Blu-Ray and DVD. They had invited about 60 members of the press, both domestic and international. We creative types were divided into teams, each one staying at its station while the journalists rotated around in groups of six to eight to hear the presentations. I was paired with Dr. Jodie Holt, the botanist from the University of California, Riverside, who had named and described the plants in the Pandoran forest. We did our joint talk no less than ten times; the last time around, Jodie half-seriously suggested that we exchange roles, with her talking about the language and me about the plants\u2014that\u2019s how familiar we had become with each other\u2019s presentations!\n\n\nIt was good to see James Cameron again, whom I hadn\u2019t talked to since the end of 2009. He looked great\u2014fit and trim (I believe he had dropped 30 pounds) and relaxed. At the time, I learned what I\u2019m sure you all know by now: there will indeed be Avatar 2 and 3, which are slated for release in 2014 and 2015 respectively. A reporter asked whether we could expect Dr. Grace Augustine to make a miraculous reappearance; Jim smiled and answered cryptically, \u201cWell, no one in science fiction ever dies.\u201d Beyond that, I don\u2019t know any more than you do about the new scripts. But I\u2019m keeping my fingers crossed that there will be some Na\u2019vi in them and that I\u2019ll be re-invited to participate.\n\n\nMy final talks of October were back on the east coast, at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. Wellesley is an all-female university . . . and what an impressive place it is. In the morning I had the great pleasure of talking to a linguistics class devoted to created languages, I believe the only such class in the country! The students were extraordinarily engaged and engaging; the professor, Dr. Angela Carpenter, had put together a rich course that they clearly loved. As a semester project, each student had to make progress in developing her own conlang, and at the start of the class, I was greeted in 16 different artificial languages, along with **kaltx****\u00ec**, which they had all practiced. In the evening, I spoke to a more general audience of about 250 people. Unfortunately the technology failed and my PowerPoint couldn\u2019t be projected onto the screen, so I had to wing it, which was a challenge. But all in all I think things went well.\n\n\n\nNOVEMBER: Australia and New Zealand\nWe spent three and half weeks Down Under, a great trip. I spoke twice\u2014first at Monash University in Melbourne and then on the west coast, in Fremantle (close to Perth), at the biennial conference of AUSIT, the Australian Institute of Interpreters and Translators, where I was the keynote speaker. I usually begin my talks by plunging into a Na\u2019vi greeting (typically: **Kaltx****\u00ec, ma oey****\u00e4 eylan. Oel ayngati kameie n****\u00ecwotx. Furia f****\u00ectsengit terok fte tsivun ayngahu teri l****\u00ec\u2019fya leNa\u2019vi piv****\u00e4ngkxo, oeru prrte\u2019 lu n****\u00ecngay**) and then explaining what I just said. This time, though, before I got up to speak, an elder of the Noongar group of indigenous people opened the conference with a beautiful\u2014and long!\u2014bilingual blessing, half of which was in fluent Noongar. When it was my turn, I had to acknowledge that what they were about to hear might not sound very impressive after that.\n\n\nThe rest of our time in Oceania was pure vacation. In addition to Melbourne and Fremantle, we toured the west coast wine-growing of Margaret River; then Sydney; then a hop over to New Zealand for five wonderful days on Waiheke Island, a little piece of heaven 35 minutes by ferry from Auckland; and then back to Melbourne before heading home to L.A. In most of those places we connected with friends we hadn\u2019t seen in years, all of whom were extremely generous with their time and hospitality.\n\n\nWhile in Melbourne I did several interviews for Radio Australia. If you have 15 minutes, you might like to listen to <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/rn/linguafranca/\">this one</a> with Maria Zijlstra of the Lingua Franca program. In my second interview with Maria, we talked not so much about Na\u2019vi but rather about the kinds of things I generally find the most fascinating about language.\n\n\nLet me conclude by congratulating Sebastian and everyone else involved with the amazing LearnNavi.org on the site\u2019s first anniversary. (More about that in the next post.) And to the many people who have written me e-mails and haven\u2019t yet received a response\u2014thank you all for your patience, and I hope to catch up on my correspondence soon.\n\n\n**Hayalovay, ma frapo.**\n\n\nta Pawl\n\n*The canonical translation is, \u201cI\u2019m so jazzed that he may be about to drink himself to death.\u201d\n\n\nEdit: error correction&#8211;**n****\u00ecn****\u00e4****k. **Also, please note that in the Lingua Franca interview I mentioned, I mangled the name of the book I was referring to: It&#8217;s **Through the Language Glass**, not **Through the Looking Glass**.

To paraphrase the lucid analysis of one of the vocabulary committee members, **li** does two jobs: (1) it indicates completion, and (2) it\u2019s a way for speakers (or writers) to react to their reasonable assumptions about what listeners (or readers) are thinking.\n\n\nFor example:\n\nHere, B sees from A\u2019s question that A is assuming she (B) hasn\u2019t yet eaten. B\u2019s response says, in effect, \u201cYou evidently think I haven\u2019t had dinner, but in fact I have.\u201d\n\nFor the negative, Na\u2019vi doesn\u2019t use a separate lexical item like English (already ~ not yet) or French (d\u00e9j\u00e0 ~ pas encore) but simply negates li:\n\n\n**Li** has some idiomatic uses as well:\n\n\nA.

As a somewhat hesitant or weak \u2018yes,\u2019 as in colloquial English \u201cWell, yeah, kind of.\u201d\n\n\nThe negative of this usage is simply **ke li**, which could be translated in colloquial English as \u2018not really.\u2019 This overlaps the \u2018not yet\u2019 usage above, but in most cases the context will disambiguate.\n\n\n\nC.

It was my best-attended talk ever: almost 400 people in the audience\u2014students, faculty, and interested people from outside the university!

Several people suggested that **pol** was incorrect, based on the evidence to date. For example, \u2018He sees you\u2019 is **Pol tse\u2019a ngati**, since **tse\u2019a** is transitive, but \u2018He CAN see you\u2019 is **Po tsun tsive\u2019a ngati**, since here, **po** is the subject not of **tse\u2019a** but of **tsun**, and helping verbs like **tsun** (also **new** and **var**) are intransitive.\n\n\nSo I thought it would be useful to clarify some things about case marking\u2014and also word order\u2014with modals.\n\nFirst, word order.\n\nI have a slide in my PowerPoint presentation about Na\u2019vi that shows how the words in a simple sentence like the one for \u2018Eytukan sees Neytiri\u2019 can be permuted in all possible ways, with all the versions grammatical and without altering the semantics of who is doing what to whom. In this case there are 3! = 6 possible permutations:\n\nThis is not to say that all six sentences are completely interchangeable in discourse. As in the vast majority of natural human languages, the word orders where the subject precedes the object (a, b, and e) are the most common; the others are grammatical but are generally used for special emphasis. For example, suppose someone thought Mo\u2019at saw Neytiri, but you know that it was actually Eytukan who saw her. The conversation could go like this:\n\n\nHere the speaker has chosen a word order that puts **Eytukan\u00ecl** at the end of the sentence to highlight the important, contrastive information\u2014just as the English translation does, but less concisely than the Na\u2019vi.\n\n\nWith a modal verb in the mix, however, the situation becomes more complicated.\n\n\nLet\u2019s take as our example sentence \u2018I want to eat teylu.\u2019 One way of saying that is **Oe new yivom teylut**. How many possible word orders are there? Well, in this case we have four words, so there are 4! = 24 logically possible orders. Bear with me as I list them all. (For brevity, I\u2019ll just use the initial letters of the four words.)\n\n\n\nAre all 24 orders grammatical? Actually, no. The rule is that except in poetry or special ceremonial language, the modal has to precede the dependent verb. This means that in these examples, N = **new** must come before Y = **yivom**. So that knocks out half of the 24 logical possibilities. We\u2019re left with these 12 word orders:\n\n\n\nNow what about the case marking? Well, it\u2019s clear that T is **teylut** throughout. As for O, **oe** is correct in all cases. But here\u2019s where it gets interesting: one of these sentences, number 9, has an alternate form where O is **oel**. That is, 9 can be either of the following:\n\n\n\nIn fact, 9b is more common than 9a. Why is that? Well, the combination of Agentive/Ergative (the \u201cl-case\u201d) followed by Patientive/Objective (the \u201ct-case\u201d) is so frequent in Na\u2019vi (e.g., **Oel ngati kameie**) that sentences like 9a are uncomfortable for many speakers. So a reanalysis takes place, where **new yivom** is thought of as a single, transitive verb, making 9b possible.\n\n\n\nAnd that ex**plai**ns why the \u2018keeping secret\u2019 sentence we started out with is OK with either **po** or **pol**.\n\n\n\n**S\u00eclpey oe, f\u00ect\u00ecoeykt\u00ecng law lilvu!**\n\n\nTa Pawl\n\nP.S.\u2014The event with Marc Okrand in Boise was a blast! I really enjoyed meeting him, and I think our joint appearance went well. It was also great to meet \u2019Eylan Ayfalulukan\u00e4, an active member of the Community, who drove a long way to be there. Oh, and I got to see and talk with my first Klingon!\n\n\n__Addendum\u2014March 22, 2011__\n\n\nThanks to everyone who contributed astute questions and comments both here and elsewhere. Let me try to clarify some of the points I made above, although I can\u2019t promise to offer definitive yes-or-no rules in all cases: constructions like this are inherently fuzzy.\n\nThere are four word orders in contention for reanalysis (which I\u2019ll expand on in a bit); I\u2019ll repeat them here for convenience:\n\n\nWhat defines these four is that in all of them, (a) NY (**new yivom**) is an uninterrupted sequence, and (b) O (**oe** or **oel**) and T (**teylut**) are contiguous.\n\n\n\nThe question is, Does O = **oe** or **oel**? As I indicated above, __\nin all cases O = **oe** is grammatically correct\n__. So it boils down to whether or not O = **oel** is __also__ acceptable to native speakers of Na\u2019vi in any of these sentences.\n\n\nI\u2019ll address that question in a moment, but first some general thoughts on linguistic variation, a large topic about which books have been written.\n\n\nAs language learners, we feel most comfortable with definite rules: \u201cIt\u2019s A, not B.\u201d But real language doesn\u2019t always work that way. Sometimes A and B are equally correct, with no difference in meaning or usage, although some speakers might be more likely to use one than the other. (In English, how do you pronounce the first syllables of **either **and **economics**? How do you contract **He is not here**\u2014**He isn\u2019t here** or **He\u2019s not here**?) As you know, Na\u2019vi is particularly rich in such \u201cfree variation\u201d (**m\u00ec fay** vs. **paym\u00ec**; **awnga** vs. **ayoeng**; **lora syulang** vs. **syulang alor**; to say \u201cWho are you?\u201d even if \u201cyou\u201d is simply **nga**, you have 12 choices!). Another kind of variation is not __within__ a given speaker but __among__ speakers: For some, A is right, B is wrong, and that\u2019s that. For others, A and B are both fine. For still others, A sounds better than B but B is still acceptable to some degree. That is to say, grammaticality judgments can vary among native speakers. (I just took a look at a textbook of mine from my graduate school days. In one of his seminal articles, Chomsky had \u201cstarred\u201d an example sentence, ***It is easy for there to be snow in June**, indicating that it was ungrammatical. I wrote in the margin that I thought the sentence was perfectly fine.) There\u2019s no reason to think the situation is any different on **Eywa\u2019eveng**. Unfortunately communication with Pandora has been difficult lately, and I haven\u2019t been able to ask any native speakers of Na\u2019vi how they feel about these sentences. (Oh for a Na\u2019vi Maltz!) So I\u2019ve had to use my intuition. That being said, here are my best guesses:\n\n\n\nThe one most likely to be judged grammatical with **oel** is 9:\n\n\nThat\u2019s judged acceptable by almost all Na\u2019vi in all but the most formal situations.\n\nThe next most likely is 15:\n\nI\u2019d put that at 50-50\u2014that is, half the Na\u2019vi will accept it, half won\u2019t.\n\nThe next is 6, which I\u2019d put at 30% acceptable, 70% unacceptable:\n\n\nFinally, 5 is generally judged unacceptable with **oel**:\n\n\nI spent some time trying to justify these intuitions, but after reading what I wrote, I didn\u2019t find the results coherent. And as they say, your mileage may vary. So I\u2019m just going to leave it there, at least for the time being. Bottom line: If you don\u2019t want to take any chances, use the intransitive-subject case in all such sentences. But in sentences like 9, feel free to choose either case.\n\nJust one more thing:\n\n\nAs I mentioned, for 9b to be judged acceptable, **new yivom** has to be reanalyzed in the speaker\u2019s mind as a single complex verb (or \u201csuper-verb,\u201d if you like). That kind of thing is not unknown in English. For example, take the passive construction, which (at least under some theories of syntax) changes a sentence like **The mouse ate the cookies** into **The cookies were eaten by the mouse**: the original object of the verb has become the new subject, along with other changes. But what about:\n\n\n\na.       The researchers didn\u2019t think of that outcome. &#8211;&gt; That outcome wasn\u2019t thought of by\nthe researchers.\n\n\nb.      Her friends spoke badly about her. &#8211;&gt; She was spoken badly about by her friends.\n\nc.       His boss took advantage of him. &#8211;&gt; He was taken advantage of by his boss.\n\n\nIf passive works on objects of verbs, then how are these passive sentences possible? After all, the new subjects are **not** the old objects of the verbs\u2014that is, if you think of the verbs as, respectively, **think**, **speak**, and **take**. But instead, speakers appear to be reanalyzing the word sequences. Rather than considering \u201cthink of\u201d as verb + preposition, they\u2019re taking it to be the super-verb \u201cthink-of.\u201d Likewise with \u201cspeak-badly-about\u201d and \u201ctake-advantage-of.\u201d If you do that, then these super-verbs __do__ have objects, which allows the passive transformation to apply.\n\n\n\nThe big question is, Under exactly what conditions do such reanalyses take place? If you come up with a complete answer to that question, please let me know!  <img src=\"Naviteri/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":-)\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />\n\n\n", "new vocabulary": [], "tags": ["grammar", "writing", "community", "formal", "discussion"]}, "\u201cReceptive Ability\u201d and Hesitation": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2011/03/%e2%80%9creceptive-ability%e2%80%9d-and-hesitation/", "content": "**\u201cReceptive Ability\u201d**\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the Na\u2019vi equivalent of English -able/-ible? That is, how do say that something is capable of \u201creceiving\u201d the action of a verb? For example, given **yom** \u2018eat,\u2019 how would you say, \u201cThis animal is edible\u201d\u2014i.e., can be eaten?\n\n\nOne obvious way is:\n\nBut there\u2019s another way:\n\n\nHere the prefix **tsuk-** (a development of **tsun **+ **fko**; no connection with **tsuks\u00ecm**) is attached to the ROOT of the verb to form an adjective. So, for example, you can say things like:\n\n\nNote that the stress is on the root, not the prefix: tsuk-YOM.\n\n\nFor the negative, **ke-** attaches before **tsuk-**: **ketsuktswa\u2019** \u2018unforgettable.\u2019\n\n\n\n**Tsuk-** is widely productive, considerably more so than English -able/-ible. For one thing, you can attach it to virtually any transitive verb: **tsukrun** \u2018findable,\u2019 **tsuktxula** \u2018constructible,\u2019 **tsukfrrfen** \u2018able to be visited (visitable?)\u2019, **tsuktaron** \u2018able to be hunted, (huntable?),\u2019 etc.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you can often attach **tsuk**&#8211; to intransitive verbs as well:\n\n\n\n**\n\nHesitation\n**\n\n\n\nTo my knowledge, all spoken languages **m\u00ec \u2019Rrta **have words or sounds that indicate the speaker is hesitating, pausing, thinking, buying time, etc. In English, we have \u201cum,\u201d \u201cuh,\u201d \u201cer,\u201d and for some people \u201clike\u201d and \u201cy\u2019know.\u201d Na\u2019vi is no exception.\n\n\n\nThe Na\u2019vi \u201chesitation marker\u201d in speech is **\u00ec\u00ec. **Unusually, it\u2019s written with a doubled vowel. (Since it\u2019s not a word any more than \u201cer\u201d is in English, it can flout the phonotactic constraints of the language, just as conversational expressions like **o\u00ecsss** and **saa** do.) It\u2019s pronounced like a prolonged **\u00ec**.\n\n\n[Note: If you&#8217;re a glutton for punishment, I added some further explanation about case marking with modals at the end of the previous post.]\n\n\n<span style=\"font-size: small;\">\nEdit 23 Mar.: In examples of transitive verbs with **tsuk**-, **tsukftang** deleted, **tsukrun**\n__\n<span style=\"font-size: small;\">added.__\n\n\n", "new vocabulary": [], "tags": ["grammar", "conversation", "discussion"]}, "Yafkeyk\u00ecri p\u00e4ngkxo frapo \u2014 Everyone talks about the weather": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2011/04/yafkeykiri-plltxe-frapo-everyone-talks-about-the-weather/", "content": "Here\u2019s the first of several posts about weather language. Thanks to the Vocabulary Committee for some great ideas!\n\nTo begin with, the subject of our discussion:\n\n\n**yafkeyk** (n.: YA.fkeyk) \u2018weather\u2019\n\n\nTo understand the derivation of this word, note the following:\n\n\n**fkeytok** (v. intr.: FKEY.tok, infixes 2, 2) \u2018exist\u2019\n\n\n\n(**Fkeytok** comes from **kifkeyti tok**, \u2018be in the world.\u2019)\n\n\nDerived form:\n\n\n**t\u00ecfkeytok** (n.) \u2018state, condition, situation\u2019\n\n\n\nNow phrases like **kilvan\u00e4 t\u00ecfkeytok** were common, and these eventually developed into shortened forms such as **kilvanfkeyk** \u2018condition of the river.\u2019 So while the above sentence is perfectly correct, the more usual way to say it in present-day Na\u2019vi is:\n\n\n\nIn this way a new suffix developed, **-fkeyk**. It\u2019s widely productive. For example:\n\n\n\nSome very common **-fkeyk** words have been lexicalized with special meanings, most notably **yafkeyk**, which originally meant \u2018the state of the atmosphere\u2019 but is now used to mean \u2018weather.\u2019\n\n\n\nTo ask about the weather, use **za\u2019u**:\n\n\n\n(Note: Be sure to place the stress in the right place with **fyape** and **pefya**: FYA.pe and pe.FYA.)\n\n\n\nIn colloquial conversation, **za\u2019u** may be omitted:\n\n\nTo answer this question, Na\u2019vi breaks weather up into several categories. The one we\u2019ll discuss in this post is precipitation.\n\n\n**A. **\n**Precipitation**\n\n\n\nWhen things fall from the sky, Na\u2019vi uses, naturally enough, the verb **zup** \u2018fall\u2019:\n\n\nHere are some other forms of precipitation:\n\n\n**tompameyp** (n.: tom.pa.MEYP) \u2018drizzle\u2019  [Comes from **tompa ameyp** \u2018weak rain\u2019]\n\n\n\n**tskxaytsy\u00ecp **(n.: TSKXAY.tsy\u00ecp) \u2018hail\u2019  [Comes from **tskxepay **+** tsy\u00ecp** (diminutive): \u2018little ice.\u2019]\n\n\n\n**herw\u00ec **(n.: HER.w\u00ec) \u2018snow\u2019\n\n\n\n**tomperw\u00ec **(n.: TOM.per.w\u00ec) \u2018sleet\u2019  [Comes from **tompa** + **herw\u00ec**]\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nWhen precipitation is particularly bad, you can use the verb **\u2019eko** \u2018attack.\u2019\n\n\n\n__Related vocabulary:__\n\n\n\n**txanfwerw\u00ec** (n.: txan.FWER.w\u00ec) \u2018blizzard\u2019  [Comes from **txan** + **hufwe** + **herw\u00ec** \u2018much wind (and) snow\u2019]\n\n\n\n**hermeyp** (n.: her.MEYP) \u2018snow flurry\u2019\n\n\n\n**hertxayo** (n:.

Must and should**\n__\n\n\n\nAs you already know, **zene** \u2018must\u2019 and **zenke** \u2018must not\u2019 work as follows:\n\n\n\n(You can also use these words impersonally: **Zene kiv\u00e4**. \u2018I/you/she/one/etc. must go. **or** It\u2019s necessary to go.\u2019 Note also the \u2018hybrid\u2019 variant: **Ngari zene** **kiv\u00e4. **Literally: \u2018As for you, it\u2019s necessary to go.\u2019 There\u2019s usually more than one way to skin a cat in Na\u2019vi! And I wonder if anyone can come up with the Pandoran equivalent of that expression . . .)\n\n\n\u2018Should\u2019 works a bit differently. The word is:\n\n\n**sweylu** (v., SWEY.lu) \u2018should\u2019\n\n\n\nThis is a development of **swey lu** \u2018it\u2019s best,\u2019 which has fused into a single word that acts somewhat like a modal . . . a quasi-modal, if you prefer, but without the hunchback. (**Oeru txoa livu.**)\n\n\n\nThe syntax depends on whether \u2018should\u2019 refers to something that hasn\u2019t yet happened (the more common situation) or something that\u2019s already happened. For the former, use **txo** \u2018if\u2019 plus the **-iv-** (subjunctive) form of the verb:\n\n\n\n(Other word orders are possible too, of course. For example, **Sweylu txo ke kiv\u00e4 nga.** And then there\u2019s the impersonal form: **Sweylu txo kiv\u00e4. **\u2018I/you/she/one/etc. should go.\u2019)\n\n\n\nFor something that\u2019s already happened, use **fwa** (= **f\u00ec\u2019u a**) or **tsawa** (= **tsa\u2019u a**) with the past or perfect indicative (that is, **non**-subjunctive):\n\n\n\n**Sl\u00e4 nari si! **This is **not** the most common use of English \u2018should have\u2019\u2014i.e., the counterfactual one, as in: \u201cYou should have gone, but you didn\u2019t, **ma skxawng**!\u201d Rather, it\u2019s more like, \u201cYou went, and in fact it was the right thing to do.\u201d Example:\n\n\n\n(Note: Tsenu\u2019s sentence above is colloquial and conversational. A more formal version would be: **Sp\u00e4ngaw oel futa fwa po kol\u00e4**** lu kxeyey.**)\n\n\n\nSo how **does** one say \u201cshould have\u201d in the counterfactual sense? **Zene maweypivey, ma eylan**. <img src=\"Naviteri/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> I\u2019m working on a post about counterfactuals in general . . .\n\n\nOne more thing before we leave this topic:\n\n\nIn English and some other languages, words like **should** and **must** have developed secondary meanings. In addition to the basic sense having to do with obligation, right and wrong, better and worse, etc. (the \u201croot\u201d sense), there\u2019s also a sense having to do with probability, likelihood, etc. (the \u201cepistemic\u201d sense). An example of the latter is, \u201cHe\u2019s on his way. He should be here any minute.\u201d As another example, consider the sentence, \u201cYou must be a doctor.\u201d That can have both a root and an epistemic interpretation:\n\n\nRoot: \u201cSon, your greatgrandfather was a doctor, your grandfather was a doctor, and I\u2019m a doctor. It\u2019s our family tradition. Whether you like it or not, I\u2019m afraid you have no choice. You must be a doctor too.\u201d\n\nEpistemic: \u201cI see you\u2019re wearing a white coat and you have a stethoscope around your neck and a prescription pad in your pocket. Hmm . . . You must be a doctor!\u201d\n\n\nThe point of all this is that Na\u2019vi does **not** allow epistemic interpretations of **zene** and **sweylu**. They\u2019re purely root. If you want the epistemic senses, you need to use probability words like **skxakep**.\n\n\nAnd finally, thanks to the vocabulary committee for:\n\n\n__\n**3. ye** (adj.) \u2018satisfied, content; satiated, \u201cfull\u201d\u2019\n__\n\n\n\nThis is an adjective of feeling, so it\u2019s used with **\u2019efu** \u2018feel\u2019 in the same way as **keftxo**, **nitram**, **ohakx**, **v\u00e4ng**, etc.\n\n\nNote the following vocabulary:\n\n\n**hasey si** (v., ha.SEY si) \u2018accomplish, bring to a conclusion\u2019\n\n\n\n**seyson\u00ecltsan **(sey.so.n\u00ecl.TSAN) \u2018well done!\u2019 (a conversational expression derived from **hasey soli n\u00ecltsan**)\n\n\nNote these two derived forms:\n\n\n**yehakx** (adj., YE.hakx) \u2018satisfied from hunger by food, \u201cfull stomach\u201d\u2019\n\n\n\n**yev\u00e4ng** (adj, YE.v\u00e4ng) \u2018satisfied from thirst by drink, feeling quenched/slaked\u2019\n\n\n\nMore weather expressions are coming . . . **Hayalovay!**\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-size: small;\">\nEdit 05 April: Added the necessary **fwa** to **Sp\u00e4ngaw oel futa fwa po kol\u00e4**** lu kxeyey. **Corrected spelling of **z****\u00ec****s****\u00ec****t\u00e4.**\n__\n\n\n", "new vocabulary": ["**kintrr** (n., KIN.trr) \u2018(7-day) week\u2019", "**mrrtrr** (n., MRR.trr) \u20185-day workweek\u2019", "**muntrr** (n., MUN.trr) \u2018weekend\u2019", "**sweylu** (v., SWEY.lu) \u2018should\u2019", "**3. ye** (adj.) \u2018satisfied, content; satiated, \u201cfull\u201d\u2019", "**hasey si** (v., ha.SEY si) \u2018accomplish, bring to a conclusion\u2019", "**yehakx** (adj., YE.hakx) \u2018satisfied from hunger by food, \u201cfull stomach\u201d\u2019", "**yev\u00e4ng** (adj, YE.v\u00e4ng) \u2018satisfied from thirst by drink, feeling quenched/slaked\u2019"], "tags": ["vocabulary", "grammar", "conversation", "colloquial", "formal", "discussion"]}, "A little puzzle": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2011/04/a-little-puzzle/", "content": "**Kaltx\u00ec, ma frapo**&#8212;\n\n\nAs you may know, I&#8217;m giving a talk this Saturday at the Southern California Undergraduate Linguistics Conference at UCLA.

It is **not** freely productive, which is to say you can\u2019t simply coin your own **\u2013nga\u2019** words at will: you need to find them in the dictionary. And on occasion the **le-** and **\u2013nga\u2019** forms exist side by side with slightly different meanings. For example:\n\n\n\n**\n__\u2019ak__ra\n** (n.: \u2019AK.ra) \u2018soil (in which plants can grow)\u2019\n\n\n\n**\u2019akra apaynga\u2019** \u2018moist soil\u2019\n\n\n\n**\u2019akra lepay** \u2018watery, saturated soil\u2019\n\n\n\n**B.\tWind**\n\n\n\nNa\u2019vi uses **t\u00ecran** \u2018walk\u2019 and **tul** \u2018run\u2019 with **hufwe** \u2018wind\u2019 to indicate the degree of windiness:\n\n\nThere\u2019s still more to be said about the weather, but that will have to wait for another time.\n\n\n__\n**Some miscellaneous vocabulary**\n__\n\n\nThree useful adverbs:\n\n\n**n\u00eclam** \u2018apparently\u2019\n\n\n\n**n\u00ecli** \u2018in advance\u2019\n\n\n\n**n\u00ecfrakrr **(n\u00ec.FRA.krr) \u2018as always\u2019\n\n\n\n***\nam__\u2019a__\n** (n.: am.\u2019A) \u2018doubt\u2019\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s much more to come, but for now I\u2019ll just say **hayalovay**.\n\n\n", "new vocabulary": ["**somwew** (n.: som.WEW) \u2018temperature\u2019", "***pup** (adj.) \u2018short (physical length)\u2019", "***ngimpup** (n.: ngim.PUP) \u2018length\u2019", "**txawew** (TXA.wew) \u2018very cold\u2019", "**tsyafe** ( TSYA.fe) \u2018mild, moderate, comfortable\u2019", "**txasom** (TXA.som) \u2018very hot\u2019", "**leyapay** (le.YA.pay) \u2018foggy, misty\u2019", "**lepwopx** (lep.WOPX) \u2018cloudy\u2019", "**paynga\u2019** (adj.: PAY.nga\u2019) \u2018moist, damp, humid\u2019", "**paynga\u2019** (PAY.nga\u2019) \u2018containing water\u2019 = \u2018moist, damp, humid\u2019", "**meuianga\u2019** (me.U.i.a.nga\u2019) \u2018containing honor\u2019 = \u2018honorable\u2019", "**txumnga\u2019** (TXUM.nga\u2019) \u2018containing poison\u2019 = \u2018poisonous\u2019"], "tags": ["vocabulary", "discussion"]}, "Some Miscellaneous Vocabulary": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2011/05/some-miscellaneous-vocabulary/", "content": "Here\u2019s the next vocabulary installment, making heavy use of the excellent proposals of the Vocabulary Committee.

It was great to meet new people in the **l\u00ec\u2019fyaolo\u2019** and reunite with old friends. **Fpom** and **t\u00ec\u2019o\u2019** abounded, and the post-panel questions in Na\u2019vi, prepared mostly in advance by community members and ably interpreted by Prrton, impressed the heck out of everyone there.\n\n\nHere\u2019s our happy group Saturday morning, July 9:\n\n\n<a href=\"http://naviteri.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Seattle-Navi.jpg\">\n<img title=\"Seattle Na'vi\" alt=\"*\" src=\"Naviteri/Seattle-Navi.jpg\" />\n</a>\n\n\n\nAnd this is the stylish free-standing plaque presented to me at the end of the panel by the community. **Ayngaru seiyi irayo, ma smuk!**\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://naviteri.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Plaque.jpg\">\n<img title=\"Plaque\" alt=\"*\" src=\"Naviteri/Plaque-768x1024.jpg\" />\n</a>\n\n\n\nThanks to the EMP administrators and staff\u2014Brooks Peck, Kristen Hoskins, and David Wulzen\u2014who welcomed us warmly and made sure things ran smoothly. And special thanks to our own Prrton, Txon\u00e4 Rolyu, and Zefanaya, who communicated with the museum, arranged for the meals and accommodations, and generally coordinated a very successful meet-up. Finally, a big **irayo** to Keyl and Chie, who graciously hosted a convivial barbecue for everyone at their home.\n\n\n\nFor those who couldn\u2019t make it . . . **n\u00ecs\u00eclpey z\u00ecs\u00ectay!** In the meantime, you might like to hear the <a href=\"http://avatar-nation.net/?page_id=33\">audio of the panel</a> provided by our friends at Avatar Nation.\n\n\nAnd now for some new vocabulary:\n\n\n**pllngay **(vin., pll.NGAY \u2013 inf. 1, 1) \u2018admit\u2019\n\n\n\nNote that this is an **intransitive** verb, working similarly to **plltxe**. So you use direct speech with it:\n\n\nTo say \u201cHe admits it\u201d:\n\n\n**kawngsar **(vtr., KAWNG.sar \u2013 inf. 2, 2) \u2018exploit\u2019\n\n\n[The following useful word plus the excellent explanation and several of the examples come from the vocabulary committee.]\n\n\n**lom** (adj.) \u2018missing, missed (as an absent person who is longed for)\u2019\n\n\n\nTo say \u201cI miss you,\u201d use **lom** in the **yawne** pattern:\n\n\n\nNote that **lom** covers only something you once had but no longer do, where there is a sense of emotional loss. For example:\n\n\n\nThat is, the old man feels bad about the fact he no longer has teeth. The sentence does **not **mean \u2018The old man is missing his teeth\u2019 in the sense of a neutral observation by an outside party.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, you can\u2019t use **lom** for something you lack but never had in the first place, as in \u201cWe almost have a quorum, but we\u2019re still missing three people.\u201d\n\n\nDerived form:\n\nThis word is reserved for special circumstances, e.g. toasts:\n\n\n**fe\u2019 **(adj.) \u2018bad\u2019\n\n\n\n(Yes, I know it&#8217;s about time we had this word. <img src=\"Naviteri/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> )\n\n\n\nNote:  **Fe&#8217;** is generally used for things, ideas, events, etc., but not for people. For \u2018a bad person,\u2019 use **kawng**.\n\n\n\nNote: In English, \u201cfight with\u201d is ambiguous\u2014it can mean either (1) fight against or (2) fight alongside (as in, \u201cDuring the so-called French and Indian War, Native Americans fought with the French against the British.\u201d) In Na\u2019vi there\u2019s no ambiguity: \u201cfight with\u201d in the sense of (1) is **wem w\u00e4**, in the sense of (2) **wem hu**.\n\n\nDerived forms:\n\n\nNote: **Fekem** derives from **fe\u2019 **+ **kem**, having taken on the special meaning of \u2018accident, unforeseen misfortune\u2019 along the way, not simply something bad that happened. For the latter, use **t\u00eclen afe\u2019**, literally \u2018bad event.\u2019\n\n\n\n**hawtsy\u00ecp** (n., HAW.tsy\u00ecp) \u2018nap\u2019\n\n\nNote the usage:\n\n\n**uran** (n., U.ran) \u2018boat\u2019\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-size: small;\">Edit July 24: t\u00eclem &#8211;&gt; t\u00eclen__\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-size: small;\">Edit Jan. 25, 2013: n\u00ecrangal z\u00ecs\u00ectay &#8211;&gt; n\u00ecs\u00eclpey z\u00ecs\u00ectay__\n\n\n", "new vocabulary": ["**lom** (adj.) \u2018missing, missed (as an absent person who is longed for)\u2019", "**hawtsy\u00ecp** (n., HAW.tsy\u00ecp) \u2018nap\u2019", "**uran** (n., U.ran) \u2018boat\u2019"], "tags": ["vocabulary", "community", "discussion"]}, "Attributive \u201ca\u201d and Truncated Style": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2011/07/attributive-%e2%80%9ca%e2%80%9d-and-truncated-style/", "content": "**Kaltx\u00ec n\u00ecmun, ma frapo.**\n\n\nI see there was some consternation about the headline of the last post!

You have only your *.\u201d What can I say?)\n\n\n\n**Sl\u00e4** . . .\n\n\n\nLanguages often have different rules for things like headlines and titles (of books, articles, poems, stories, songs, movies, etc.). In fact, if you think about the English translation I gave, \u201cGreat Meeting in Seattle,\u201d you\u2019ll realize that that\u2019s not grammatical in standard English conversation or writing. You\u2019d have to add an article: \u201cI really enjoyed **the** great meeting . . .\u201d or \u201cI heard there was **a** great meeting . . .\u201d or even \u201cThat was **some** great meeting . . . !\u201d For a headline, though, \u201cGreat Meeting\u201d by itself is OK. We can call this style \u201cTruncated Headline\u201d style.\n\n\n\nNa\u2019vi has a truncated style as well. Now the Na\u2019vi don\u2019t have books or newspapers or blog posts, but they do have stories and legends and songs, and truncated style is possible for their titles. One of the indicators of truncated style is the omission of attributive \u201ca\u201d where it would otherwise be necessary. Another is the elision (omission) of certain verbs.

Some of the material that follows is directly or indirectly due to them.)\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with a simple question: How do you say, \u201cYou two are teachers\u201d?\n\n\n\u201cYou two are\u201d is straightforward: **Menga lu . . . **But what about \u201cteachers\u201d? Should it be **meharyu**,  using the dual form to match the dual of **menga**? Should you use the plural form, (**ay)haryu**? Or should it simply be the singular, **karyu**?\n\n\nThe answer is based on this general principle of Na\u2019vi grammar:\n\n\nYou\u2019ve seen the KH in action before. For example, you know that \u201cfive stingbats\u201d and \u201cmany viperwolves\u201d is **mrra riti** and **pxaya nantang** respectively, not ***mrra ayriti** and ***pxaya aynantang**. Since number is already expressed by \u201cfive\u201d and \u201cmany,\u201d you don\u2019t need a plural marker on the nouns, which remain in the \u201cunmarked\u201d or singular form.\n\n\nNow we can answer the original question:\n\n Here are a few more examples:\n\n\nIn these examples, number is already shown by what comes before **lu** (the subjects of the sentences), so following the KH, what comes after **lu** (in the predicates) isn\u2019t marked for number. Sentences with **slu** work the same way.\n\n\nSo far so good, I hope. But there\u2019s a little complication. Note the following contrasting bits of conversation:\n\n\n(Note here that even if you omit the optional pronoun **fo** \u201cthey\u201d in the response, **\u2019eylan** \u201cfriends\u201d remains in the singular, since **fo** is understood. And we **do** have the number marking on **fo**, since it\u2019s in a different clause\u2014in fact, a whole different sentence. This illustrates why the KH has the \u201cper clause\u201d restriction.)\n\n\nBut:\n\n\nThe question in B violates the KH, since the question word in the predicate, **supe**, is here marked for number.  Why is that?\n\n\nThe difference is that when you ask \u201cWho are X?\u201d where X is a group, you can be requesting two different things: (1) identify the defining characteristic of the group, or (2) identify each member of the group. The A conversation above has the interpretation in (1): Q: What characterizes that group of warriors? A: They\u2019re Tsu\u2019tey\u2019s friends. The B conversation has the second interpretation: Identify each of those warriors.\n\nFor \u201cdefining characteristic\u201d questions, the KH holds; for \u201cidentify\u201d questions, it doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s why we have the following question about family members:\n\nFinally, a couple of related items:\n\n\n**\n__Generics__\n**\n\n\nTo make general statements about a group, keep the nouns in the singular:\n\nWe sometimes do similar things in English. For example, \u201cThe unicorn is a mythical beast.\u201d\n\n\n**\n__\nForms with **pe-**\n__\n**\n\n\n\n** **In the examples above we\u2019ve seen several familiar ways of translating \u201cwho?\u201d ( = what person?/ what people?) \u2013 **tupe**, **pesu**, **(ay)supe**. But since Na\u2019vi has four degrees of number (singular, dual, trial, plural), three ways for addressing gender (common gender, masculine, feminine), and the possibility of **pe** either as a prefix or suffix, there are quite a few other such forms\u2014in fact, 24 in all (4 x 3 x 2). In other words, for the simple question \u201cWho is here?\u201d you can be very specific in Na\u2019vi, with separate pronoun forms for \u201cWhat woman?\u201d \u201cWhat two men?\u201d \u201cWhat three people?\u201d etc. Example:\n\n\nHere\u2019s the complete chart. Don\u2019t get scared and think you have to memorize all of these forms! Only a few of them turn up frequently.\n\nStressed syllables are underlined.\n\nFor example, 13 and 14 mean \u201cWhat three people?\u201d 15 and 16: \u201cWhat three men?\u201d 17 and 18: \u201cWhat three women?\u201d\n\n\nFor those who are interested, the derivations of these words involve lenition, nasal assimilation (the n of **tutan** has become m under the influence of the following p), and the loss of some unstressed vowels. Final **te** is dropped as well (as in **pesu**, not ***pesute**). Examples:\n\n\n\n10. me + tu__tan__ + pe &gt; mesu__tan__pe &gt; mesu__tam__pe &gt; me__stam__pe\n\n\n\n13. pe + pxe + __tu__te &gt; pe + pxe__su__te &gt; pepe__su__te &gt; pep__su__te &gt; pep__su__\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s more to say about **pe-**, of course, since it\u2019s very widely used. For example, here\u2019s how it interacts with **kem** \u2018action\u2019:\n\n\n\n**\n**kem**\n**\n\n\nAs you see, the general paradigm is:\n\n\nAs for such questions as how **pe-** interacts with **fne-** \u2018kind, type\u2019 and how it works with the full variety of nouns, we\u2019ll leave those for another time.\n\n\n\n**Hayalovay!**\n\n\n", "new vocabulary": [], "tags": ["grammar", "discussion"]}, "New Vocabulary: Clothing": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2011/08/new-vocabulary-clothing/", "content": "Today\u2019s vocabulary centers around clothing\u2014items of apparel, some specific to Pandora and some more general, plus ways of talking about putting on, wearing, and taking off.

When you\u2019re reporting what someone said, the most idiomatic way to express that in Na\u2019vi is to use **plltxe** intransitively, with **san** and **s\u00eck**. You also know that Na\u2019vi likes direct speech, where you\u2019re quoting someone\u2019s words exactly, rather than indirect speech. So:\n\n\n\n**\nPoltxe po san oe new kiv\u00e4 s\u00eck.\n**\u2018He said, \u201cI want to go.\u201d\u2019 OR \u2018He said he wanted to go.\u2019\n\n\n\nAs you see, there are two ways to do it in English but only one in Na\u2019vi. In this structure, it might help to think of **plltxe** as \u201cspeak\u201d and **san** as \u201csay\u201d: \u2018He spoke, saying \u201cI want to go.\u201d\u2019\n\n\nNow how do you translate simple things like \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d and \u201cShe didn\u2019t say that\u201d?\n\n\nFor these, we use **plltxe **as a transitive verb. But what do you use for \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cthat\u201d in those sentences? The obvious candidates are **peut** and **tsat **respectively:\n\n\n\n**\nPoltxe pol peut?\n**\u2018What did she say?\u2019\n\n\n\n**\nKe poltxe pol tsat.\n**\u2018She didn\u2019t say that.\u2019\n\n\n\n[For the record, I\u2019ve used VSO order here, but of course other word orders are just as possible: **Pol poltxe peut? Peut poltxe pol?** And so on . . . ]\n\n\n\nThe two sentences above are acceptable Na\u2019vi, but they\u2019re not the best style. The reason is that they\u2019re using forms of the catch-all word **\u2019u**, \u2018thing\u2019\u2014you\u2019re talking about saying a**thing**. Na\u2019vi prefers to be more specific: what you say is **words**. So more idiomatic versions of these sentences are:\n\n\n\n**\nPoltxe pol payl\u00ec\u2019ut?\n**\u2018What did she say?\u2019 [= What words did she say?]\n\n\n\n**\nKe poltxe pol tsayl\u00ec\u2019ut.\n**\u2018She didn\u2019t say that.\u2019  [=She didn\u2019t say those words.]\n\n\n\n(If you\u2019re talking about a single word, it\u2019s **tsal\u00ec\u2019ut**.)\n\n\n\nTransitive **plltxe** can also be used for reported speech:\n\n\n\n**\nPoltxe pol fayl\u00ec\u2019ut a oe new kiv\u00e4.\n**\u2018She said, \u201cI want to go.\u201d\u2019 OR \u2018She said she wanted to go.\u2019\n\n\n\nJust as **f\u00ec\u2019ut a** usually contracts in colloquial conversation to the single word **futa**, **fayl\u00ec\u2019ut a** contracts to **fayluta**:\n\n\n\n**\nPoltxe pol fayluta oe new kiv\u00e4.\n**\u2018She said, \u201cI want to go.\u201d\u2019 OR \u2018She said she wanted to go.\u2019\n\n\n\nNote that whether you use the **plltxe san . . . s\u00eck** or the **plltxe fayluta** structure, you still use direct speech, reporting the exact words the person said. But keep in mind that **plltxe san . . . s\u00eck** is the more idiomatic choice in Na\u2019vi and the one you should prefer for reported speech.\n\n\n\nFor \u2018hear\u2019 and \u2018tell\u2019 in this context, Na\u2019vi again prefers a more specific object than **\u2019u**. What you hear is news or a report\u2014i.e. **fmawn**. **Fmawnit a** contracts conversationally to **fmawnta**:\n\n\n\n**\nStolawm oel fmawnta fo new hivum.\n**\u2018I heard they want to leave.\u2019\n\n\n\n**\nNgal poleng oer fmawnta po tolerkup.\n**\u2018You told me that he died.\u2019\n\n\n\n__Reported and indirect questions__\n\n\nHow do you say, \u201cHe asked where Neytiri was going\u201d?\n\n\nWith **pawm **as with **plltxe**, there are both transitive and intransitive structures. The intransitive forms are by far the more common:\n\n\n\n**\nPolawm po san Neytiri k\u00e4 pesengne (s\u00eck).\n**\u2018He asked where Neytiri was going.\u2019 (Literally: He asked, saying, \u201cWhere is Neytiri going?\u201d)\n\n\n\nOne wrinkle: With **pawm** but not with **plltxe**, the **san** is optional. So this is also possible, and in fact quite common:\n\n\n\n**Polawm po, Neytiri k\u00e4 pesengne?**\n\n\n\nThe transitive use of **pawm** is possible but infrequent, since there\u2019s another transitive verb that\u2019s much more common in this structure:\n\n\n\n**vin** (vtr.) \u2018ask for, request\u2019\n\n\n\nThis has wider applications than just asking a question\u2014it can be used in place of **\u00e4tx\u00e4le si**:\n\n\n\n**\n\u00c4tx\u00e4le si tsn\u00ec livu oheru Uniltaron.\n**Or:\n**\nVuyin ohel Uniltaronit.\n**\u2018I respectfully request the Dreamhunt.\u2019\n\n\n\n**\nPol volin mipa tskalepit.\n**\u2018He asked for a new crossbow.\u2019\n\n\n\nTo use **vin** with indirect questions, what\u2019s the appropriate object?

Second, if you omitted **f\u00ectsap**, the sentence would mean that the two of them hugged **themselves**\u2014that is, A hugged A and B hugged B rather than A hugged B and B hugged A.\n\n\n\nNote also that the verb **pom** \u2018kiss\u2019 and the derived noun **s\u00e4pom** \u2018a kiss\u2019 are parallel in all respects to **meyam** and **s\u00e4myam**.\n\n\n\n**\n\nnu\u00e4\n** (adp.+, NU.\u00e4) \u2018beyond\u2019\n\n\n\n**\nAwnga kelku si nu\u00e4 ayram alus\u00ecng.\n**\u2018We live beyond the flying mountains.\u2019\n\n\n\nNote the difference between **nu\u00e4 **\u2018beyond\u2019 and **few** \u2018across, aiming for the opposite side of.\u2019\n\n\n\n**Fo kelku si few \u2019ora.**\n\u2018They live across the lake.\u2019 (That is, on the opposite side of the lake, on the other shore.)\n\n\n\n**Fo kelku si nu\u00e4 ora.**\n\u2018They live beyond the lake.\u2019 (That is, a great distance beyond and out of sight of the lake.)\n\n\n\n(I\u2019m sure everyone knows why it\u2019s **\u2019ora** in one but **ora** in the other. <img src=\"Naviteri/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> )\n\n\n\n**\n\nkanfp\u00ecl\n** (vin., KAN.fp\u00ecl \u2014 inf. 1, 2) \u2018concentrate, focus one\u2019s attention\u2019\n\n\n\n**\nFuria sney\u00e4 tskoti ngop po kanfp\u00ecl.\n**\u2018He\u2019s concentrating on making his bow.\u2019\n\n\n\n**\nTxo new nga tslivam, zene kivanfp\u00ecl.\n**\u2018If you want to understand, you have to concentrate.\u2019\n\n\n\n**\n\nfmokx\n** (n.) \u2018jealousy, envy\u2019\n\n\n\nThe syntax is: **Lu oeru fmokx.** \u2018I\u2019m jealous.\u2019\n\n\n\nNote that **fmokx** carries a neutral connotation unless otherwise specified with **\n**\u2039**\n****\n\u00e4ng**\u203a**\n**or**\n**\u2039**\n****\nei**\u203a**.\n**\n\n\n\n**\nFuria f\u00ectxan fn\u00e4ngan Ulrey\u00ecl tsko swizawit, lu oeru fmokx.\n**\u2018I\u2019m jealous of the fact that Ulrey is such an excellent archer.\u2019\n\n\n\n**\nFko plltxeie san menga muntxa slolu s\u00eck!

The theme this time was \u201c**Teri fwa fmal f\u00ecl\u00ec\u2019fyati ayawne:** On keeping this beloved language alive\u201d and the categories were once again poetry and prose. (If you missed the original announcement that included the judging criteria, you can find it here.)\n\n\nThe judges have now sent me the winning entries, and as I did last year, I\u2019m delighted to announce the names of the winners and share their wonderful work with you.\n\n\nI\u2019m continually impressed with the quality of the Na\u2019vi coming out of the Community. Perhaps you can imagine how gratifying it is for someone like me to see the language he developed used for communication in such elegant, creative, and moving ways. **Awngey\u00e4 li\u2019fyari ayngey\u00e4 t\u00ecyawn oeru teya seiyi n\u00ecngay**.\n\n\n\n**Txana irayo** to the judges who worked so diligently to adjudicate the entries fairly\u2014and to **everyone** who submitted poems and prose. Even if you didn\u2019t win this time, I hope you found the process valuable and enjoyable. **Ulte kxawm z\u00ecyeva\u2019u ngane t\u00ecyora\u2019 z\u00ecs\u00ectay!**\n\n\n\nAnd now to the winners. This time the two top entries in each category were so close, the judges didn\u2019t feel there was enough difference to distinguish them. So we have two winners in each category. **Seykxel s\u00ec nitram **to **Alyara Arati**, **Blue Elf**, **Ikran Ahiy\u00eck**, and **Lance R. Casey**. Your work is reproduced below, in alphabetical order of your names.\n\n\n\n**Note:** The question came up about how to say \u201cpoem\u201d in Na\u2019vi.\n\n\n\nThe answer is simple: It\u2019s **way**, the word that usually means \u201csong.\u201d Since among the Na\u2019vi, poetry is generally sung or recited in a melodic way, poetry and song are considered the same thing. This is true in a number of earth languages as well.\n\n\nIf to avoid confusion you need to distinguish a spoken poem from a song, the expressions are:\n\n\n**way a plltxe **\u2018spoken poem\u2019\n**way a rol **\u2018song\u2019\n\n\n\nIf you need to refer specifically to the words of a poem or the lyrics of a song, it\u2019s what you expect: **way\u00e4 ayl\u00ec\u2019u**.\n\n\n\n** **\n\n\n\n**Poetry by Alyara Arati**\n\n\n\n**A moving expression of what Na\u2019vi has meant to this poet.**\n\n\n\nkeftxo \u2019armefu,\ntsngarmawv\u00e4ng\u00eck n\u00ec\u2019awtu\nayfay\u00ecvaru,\nkrr a l\u00ec\u2019fyati\noel rolun, alu Na\u2019vi\na t\u00ectxen soli\nelturu oey\u00e4\ns\u00ec\u2019efurs\u00ec txe\u2019lan\u00e4,\na lalmu sy\u00e4\u2019\u00e4.\n\n\n\nha fmoli oe\nf\u00ecl\u00ec&#8217;fyati nivume\nhufwa n\u00ec\u2019awve\ns\u00e4sul\u00ecn n\u00ec\u2019aw\nlolu talun ke spolaw\noel mi futa tsaw\ntsolun zeykivo\nke\u2019uti oeru keng txo\nnivew tsat frato.\n\n\n\nsl\u00e4 \u2019uo lolen\na teri oer ke lolu \u2019en,\nngian tsrolanten\noeru n\u00ectxan nang:\nke tsolun oe ftivang\n\u2019ivong na syulang.\ntengkrr ftolia\ntsawl slolu m\u00ec oey vitra\nNa\u2019viy\u00e4 fp\u00eclfya.\n\n\n\nf\u00ecl\u00ec\u2019fyar, tafral,\nlu txanwawea ayral\nulte oeti fmal\nf\u00ec\u2019ul Eywapxel.\nset \u2019efu oe seykxel\nn\u00ec\u2019ul fa pamrel\na oer stum swok lam\ntaluna sleyku nitram\noet, s\u00ec txantslusam.\n\n\n\nza\u2019u ta txe\u2019lan\nayl\u00ec\u2019u atxanatan;\nn\u00ecngay lu txantsan.\nf\u00ecl\u00ec\u2019fya frakrr\nlayu pum t\u00ecyawn\u00e4 oer;\nsar f\u00ec\u2019ut tengkrr\nhu Yawntu aNawm\noe plltxe m\u00ec s\u00ecvawm\nulte oet Pol stawm.\n\n\n\noel spaw tsat talun\nleNa\u2019via srungit tsun\noe mi rivun,\nalu fwa m\u00ec oey\nvitra mipa t\u00ectstew rey,\na fya\u2019o aswey\nlu fte pivllngay\noer fwa lu oe n\u00ecngay\npxan t\u00ec\u2019i\u2019avay.\n\n\n\nmi leykeratem\nf\u00ecl\u00ec\u2019fyal oet n\u00ecme\u2019em\nm\u00ecfa oey ronsem;\npxiset f\u00ec\u2019ut kin\noel na unil akalin.\nnew piveng n\u00ectxin\nsan Na\u2019vi \u2019ivong\nfa f\u00ecpamrel natkenong;\noet n\u00ecngay zerong.\n****\n\n\n\n**\nProse by Blue Elf:\n**\n\n\n\n**Why this author likes Na\u2019vi . . . and what will keep it alive.**\n\n\nL\u00ec\u2019fya leNa\u2019vi\u2014peu lu tsaw?

As you know, the general rule for forming an agent (the one who does the action) from a verb is to add the suffix **\u2013yu**:\n\n\n\n**karyu** \u2018teacher\u2019; **ngopyu** \u2018creator\u2019; **t\u00e4ftxuyu** \u2018weaver\u2019; **taronyu** \u2018hunter\u2019; etc.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, **-tu** is generally added to non-verbs:\n\n\n\n**fnawe\u2019tu** \u2018coward\u2019; **fyeyntu** \u2018adult person\u2019; **lomtu** \u2018missed person\u2019; **ultxatu** \u2018meeting participant\u2019; **w\u00e4tu** \u2018opponent\u2019; etc.\n\n\n\nThose are the general rules, and they apply perhaps 95 percent of the time. But **\u2013tu** can be unpredictable. You\u2019ve already seen examples of that:\n\n\n\nIn **spe\u2019etu** \u2018captive,\u2019 **\u2013tu** has been added to the verb **spe\u2019e** \u2018capture\u2019 to indicate the recipient of the action, rather like the **\u2013ee** suffix in English (honoree, interviewee).\n\n\n\nIn **frrtu** \u2018guest,\u2019 it\u2019s not clear what **\u2013tu** has been added to, since there\u2019s no word ***frr** in modern Na\u2019vi (although it may be an archaic form); the verb for visit is **frrfen**, so **frrtu** replaces the expected ***frrfenyu**.\n\n\n\nAnd there are places where you expect **\u2013tu** but find **\u2013yu** instead: \u2018warrior\u2019 is **tsamsiyu**, not ***tsamtu**. (Compare: **tsulf\u00e4** \u2018mastery\u2019; **tsulf\u00e4 si** \u2018to master\u2019; **tsulf\u00e4tu** \u2018master of an art, craft, or skill\u2014not ***tsulf\u00e4siyu**.)\n\n\n\nThe words for \u2018winner\u2019 and \u2018loser\u2019 are further additions to the list of oddly behaved **\u2013tu** words:\n\n\n\n**yora\u2019tu** (n., yo.RA\u2019.tu) \u2018winner\u2019\n\n\n\n**snaytu** (n., SNAY.tu) \u2018loser\u2019\n\n\n\nNote that **snaytu** is doubly exceptional, since **snaytx** \u2018lose\u2019 ends in a **pxorpam**.

The **\u2013tu** suffix is not productive, so don\u2019t try to coin these words yourself\u2014you need to find them in the dictionary.\n\n\n", "new vocabulary": ["**yora\u2019tu** (n., yo.RA\u2019.tu) \u2018winner\u2019", "**snaytu** (n., SNAY.tu) \u2018loser\u2019"], "tags": ["grammar", "discussion"]}, "One more for 2011": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2011/12/one-more-for-2011/", "content": "Here\u2019s the last post for 2011, with a bit of new grammar. I have a large backlog of vocabulary I want to get to you, but that will have to wait until next year.\n\nCONTRASTIVE DEMONSTRATIVES\n\nThis sounds intimidating, but it\u2019s actually a simple concept.\n\nSuppose you\u2019re an experienced mycologist gathering mushrooms in the forest with a friend. You see two different mushrooms under a tree\u2014one edible, one deadly. So you say to your friend as you point them out, \u201cThis mushroom is delicious; that mushroom will kill you.\u201d\n\nHow would you pronounce that last sentence?\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a native speaker of English, you\u2019d put heavy stress on the two demonstratives, **this** and **that**:\n\n\n\u201cTHIS mushroom is delicious; THAT mushroom will kill you.\u201d\n\n\nI mention \u201cnative speaker\u201d because although that kind of stress pattern\u2014what we call \u201ccontrastive stress\u201d\u2014is so natural to native English speakers they don\u2019t even think about it, it\u2019s **not** natural in many other languages. When I was teaching ESL, I kept encountering student learners with very good English skills who nevertheless would pronounce the mushroom sentence like this:\n\n\n\u201cThis MUSHroom is delicious; that MUSHroom will kill you.\u201d\n\n\nLanguages that don\u2019t use stress to show contrast have other ways of doing it. (For those of you who speak French, think of **ce jardin** vs. **ce jardin-ci**, **ce jardin-l\u00e0**.)\n\n\n\n**Ha . . . L\u00ec\u2019fyari leNa\u2019vi pefya?**\n\n\n\nAs you know, the Na\u2019vi demonstratives **f\u00ec-** and **tsa-** are prefixed to their nouns and **not** stressed, so a simple English-like pattern isn\u2019t possible. Instead, Na\u2019vi uses apposition with **alu **and a redundant pronoun. Here\u2019s the mushroom sentence in Na\u2019vi. (I\u2019ve used **fkxen**, \u2018food of vegetable origin\u2019 as a generic vegetable here.)\n\n\n\n**\nF\u00ecfkxen alu F\u00cc&#8217;u lu ftx\u00eclor; tsafkxen (or: pum) alu TSA&#8217;u ngati tspang.\n**\u2018THIS vegetable is delicious; THAT one will kill you.\u2019\n\n\n\nNote that there **is** (IS!) contrastive stress here, but it\u2019s on the **fi-/tsa-** of the pronoun, not of the noun. (These prefixes, of course, are not capitalized in normal writing.)\n\n\nAnother example:\n\n\n**\nF\u00eckaryu alu f\u00ecpo lu tsulf\u00e4tu; tsakaryu alu tsapo lu skxawng.\n**\u2018This teacher is a master; that teacher is a fool.\u2019\n\n\n\nMORE ON **F\u00ccTSAP**\n\n\n\nWe saw a few posts back that the adverb **f\u00ectsap** \u2018each other\u2019\u2014another useful translation is &#8216;reciprocally&#8217;\u2014is used with the reflexive infix **\u2013\u00e4p-** in transitive verbs to indicate reciprocal action:\n\n\n\n**\nZ\u00ecs\u00ecto avol ke ts\u00e4pole\u2019a fo f\u00ectsap.\n**\u2018They haven\u2019t seen each other in eight years.\u2019\n\n\n\nBut what happens if the verb is intransitive? Reflexive **\u2013\u00e4p- **is only used with transitive verbs (and some **si**&#8211; constructions).\n\n\n\nIf you think about it, it\u2019s odd to use \u2018each other\u2019 with intransitives: you can see each other, love each other, and slap each other, but you can\u2019t sleep each other, talk each other, or swim each other. However, a number of important transitive verbs in English have intransitive counterparts in Na\u2019vi: \u201cI love you\u201d = **Nga yawne lu oer**, \u201cI know you\u201d = **Nga smon oer**.\n\n\n\nSo how do you say \u201cWe know each other\u201d in Na\u2019vi? **F\u00ecfya**:\n\n\n\n**\nMoe smon moeru f\u00ectsap.\n**\u2018We know each other.\u2019\n\n\n\nLiterally, this says: \u2018We are familiar with us (i.e., with ourselves) reciprocally.\u2019 With **moe**, of course, you\u2019re talking to a third party about yourself and another person.\n\n\n\nNote that **moeru** is optional: **Moe smon f\u00ectsap** is fine and means the same thing.\n\n\nAnother example:\n\n\n**\nMa muntxatu, oeng yawne lu (oengaru) f\u00ectsap, kefyak?\n**\u2018We love each other, don\u2019t we, my spouse?\u2019\n\n\nWith the third person, things get a bit more complicated.\n\n\nFirst off, how do you say \u201cHe sees himself?\u201d Easy: **Po ts\u00e4pe\u2019a**. But what about \u201cHe loves himself?\u201d You can\u2019t use **\u2013\u00e4p-** here. If you say, **Po yawne lu por**, you\u2019re saying that he loves him/her\u2014that is, someone not himself.\n\n\n\nRecall that we encountered a similar situation with possessive pronouns, in which case **sney\u00e4** came to the rescue:\n\n\n\n**\nPol \u2019olem pey\u00e4 wutsot.\n**\u2018He made his (i.e., someone else&#8217;s) dinner.\u2019\n\n\n\n**\nPol \u2019olem sney\u00e4 wutsot.\n**He made his (own) dinner.\n\n\n\n**Sney\u00e4** has a relative **snor(u)** \u2018to himself, to herself, to itself, to themselves\u2019 which comes to the rescue here:\n\n\n\n**\nPo yawne lu snor.\n**\u2018He loves himself.\u2019\n\n\n\nReturning to the original question, with **snor(u)** and **f\u00ectsap** we can translate \u201cknow each other\u201d and \u201clove each other\u201d-type sentences in the third person:\n\n\n\n**\nMefo yawne lu (snor) f\u00ectsap.\n**\u2018They (=those two) love each other.\u2019\n\n\n\n(Like **sney\u00e4**, **snor(u)** isn\u2019t changed for number.)\n\n\n\n**\nFo smon (snoru) f\u00ectsap n\u00ecwotx.\n**\u2018They all know each other.\u2019\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s more to say about the **sno** family, but that will have to wait until another time.\n\n\nLet\u2019s hope 2012 is a healthy, happy, productive, and fulfilling year for all of us.\n\n\n**Hayalovay!**\n\n\n\n**Ta Pawl**\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-size: small;\">\nEdit 1/01: ***Nga smon lu oer** corrected to **Nga smon oer**.

So here\u2019s a bit of grammar and a few new vocabulary items for Leap Day (hope it was a good one), just under the wire.\n\n\n\n**NOUN FORMATION: t\u00ec- vs. s\u00e4-**\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re already very familiar with both these prefixes, which create nouns, usually out of other parts of speech. Looking at some **t\u00ec-** words, for example:\n\n\n\n**S\u00e4-** creates nouns in much the same way:\n\n\nSo what\u2019s the difference between these two noun formers?\n\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that neither one is productive. That is, you\u2019re not free to coin new **t\u00ec-** and **s\u00e4-** words at will; you need to find them in the dictionary and learn their meanings. However, there are some rough guidelines that will help you distinguish **t\u00ec-** and **s\u00e4-** words. I say \u201crough\u201d because Na\u2019vi is not completely consistent in this area: as in natural Earth languages that have evolved over time, exceptions to the general rules are not uncommon.\n\n\n\nThe meaning of a **t\u00ec-** noun is **generally** the **abstract idea or concept** embodied in the verb, adjective, or noun it\u2019s based on. So **t\u00echawnu** is the idea of protecting, that is, protection; **t\u00eckanu** is the concept of being intelligent, that is, intelligence; **t\u00eclor** is beauty, from **lor** \u2018beautiful.\u2019\n\n\n\nYou can immediately think of some common exceptions to this rule: **t\u00ecrol**, from **rol** \u2018sing,\u2019 means song, not the idea of singing. (To talk about singing in general, use **t\u00ec-** along with the first-position infix **\u2013us-**; this process **is** productive\u2014i.e., you can do it with virtually any verb. **T\u00ecrusol lu oeru mowan**. \u2018Singing is enjoyable to me.\u2019) **T\u00ecp\u00e4hem** means arrival in the sense of a particular arrival, not arrival in the abstract sense. That\u2019s just how it is: these items need to be learned like all other vocabulary.\n\n\n\nAlthough there are exceptions for **s\u00e4-** nouns as well, the usage here is more consistent. There are two basic uses of **s\u00e4- **(with some overlap):\n\n\n\n__\nA. To indicate an **instrument**:\n__\n\n\n\nA **s\u00e4**&#8211; noun can be the **instrument** or **tool**, or the **means by which** something is achieved.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n__\nB. To indicate a **particular, concrete instance **of a general action:\n__\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\nWhen both **t\u00ec-** and **s\u00e4-** nouns exist for the same root, the difference can be especially clear. For example, we saw in an earlier post that from the adjective **\u2019ipu** \u2018humorous, funny, amusing\u2019 we derive the two nouns **t\u00ec\u2019ipu** and **s\u00e4\u2019ipu**. **T\u00ec\u2019ipu **is the abstract concept of being humorous, that is, humor in general; **s\u00e4\u2019ipu **is a** **particular instance of being humorous\u2014for example, a joke.\n\n\n\nFinally, let me correct an error on my part. The verb **mok** \u2018suggest\u2019 yields two nouns, **t\u00ecmok** and **s\u00e4mok**, both meaning \u2018suggestion.\u2019 The distinction, as you can predict, is that **t\u00ecmok** is the abstract idea of suggesting, while **s\u00e4mok** is a concrete instance of suggesting, i.e. a suggestion.\n\n\n\n**\nF\u00ectxeleri t\u00ecmok ke tam; zene fko fngivo\u2019.\n**\u2018In this matter, suggesting won\u2019t cut it; you need to demand.\u2019\n\n\n\n**\nFey\u00e4 ays\u00e4mok lu fe\u2019 n\u00ecwotx.\n**\u2018All of their suggestions are bad.\u2019\n\n\n\nAt least once I used **t\u00ecmok **when it should be have been **s\u00e4mok. ** Thanks to everyone who pointed that out. **Ngaytxoa, krro t\u00eckxey si keng karyu**.\n\n\n\n**MORE AND LESS**\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re already familiar with **n\u00ec\u2019ul**, the adverb meaning \u2018more.\u2019 It comes from the verb **\u2019ul** \u2018increase.\u2019 Its opposite is **n\u00e4n**, \u2018decrease,\u2019 and there\u2019s a parallel adverb as well.\n\n\n\n**\u2019ul** (vin.) \u2018increase\u2019\n\n\n\n**n\u00e4n** (vin.) \u2018decrease\u2019\n\n\n\n**n\u00ecn\u00e4n** (adv., n\u00ec.N\u00c4N) \u2018less\u2019\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n**\nRutxe wivem n\u00ecn\u00e4n.\n**\u2018Please fight less.\u2019\n\n\n\n**\nAyhapx\u00ectu pongu\u00e4 txopu si n\u00ecn\u00e4n takrra Va\u2019rul pxekutut l\u00e4txayn.\n**\u2018The members of the group are less afraid since Va\u2019ru defeated three of the enemy.\u2019\n\n\nWe also have the following adverbs:\n\n\n**n\u00ec\u2019ul\u2019ul** (adv., n\u00ec.\u2019UL.\u2019ul) \u2018increasingly, more and more\u2019\n\n\n\n**n\u00ecn\u00e4n\u00e4n** (adv., n\u00ec.N\u00c4.n\u00e4n.) \u2018decreasingly, less and less\u2019\n\n\n\n**\nFralo a taron, oey\u00e4 \u2019itan txopu si n\u00ecn\u00e4n\u00e4n.\n**\u2018Each time he hunts, my son becomes less and less afraid.\u2019\n\n\n\n**\nFraz\u00ecs\u00eckrr pay kilvan\u00e4 n\u00e4n n\u00ec\u2019ul\u2019ul.\n**\u2018Every season the river dries up more and more.\u2019\n\n\n\nAnd we now have the way to say \u201cthe more . . . the more\u201d and \u201cthe less . . . the less\u201d (known to grammarians as \u201ccorrelative comparisons\u201d).

You already know more about this than you think.\n\n\nAs we saw with the **lok** examples above, the same Na\u2019vi verb can be transitive in one context and intransitive in another. The same thing happens in many other languages\u2014for example, English. Take the verb **eat**. Sometimes it\u2019s transitive, with an overt object: \u201cI\u2019m eating a cupcake.\u201d Sometimes, it\u2019s intransitive, where the object isn\u2019t specified, and the focus is on **the act of eating **rather than on what\u2019s being eaten: \u201cDon\u2019t bother me now\u2014I\u2019m eating.\u201d Such verbs are sometimes referred to as \u201cambitransitive.\u201d There are many other such verbs\u2014**understand,** **read**, **write**, **win**, **lose**, **hunt**, etc.\n\n\n\nBut in English, many transitive verbs **cannot** be used intransitively. We can say **He always rejects such offers** but not ***He always rejects.**\n\n\n\nNa\u2019vi, however, is much freer than English in this regard. Most if not all transitive verbs **can** be used intransitively. So, for example, we have:\n\n\nand also:\n\n\nSo when you see a Na\u2019vi verb marked VTR, you can feel pretty confident that it can be used intransitively as well. Note that this does **not **work the other way around: intransitive verbs can\u2019t be used transitively unless you add something to **make** them transitive. For example, **t\u00e4txaw** is the intransitive verb \u2018return,\u2019 as in \u201cI\u2019ll return at 3:00.\u201d For the transitive sense of \u2018return,\u2019 as \u201cPlease return the book you borrowed,\u201d you need to add the causative infix &lt;eyk&gt;: **teyk\u00e4txaw** \u2018cause to return\u2019\u2014that is, return in the transitive sense!\n\n\nOne little complication: Just because a transitive verb doesn\u2019t have an object in its clause, you can\u2019t always conclude that it\u2019s being used intransitively. For example, to say \u2018The teylu I\u2019m eating is delicious,\u2019 which is correct, A or B?\n\nThe answer is B. If you\u2019re having trouble seeing this, think of it this way: The sentence \u201cstarted out\u201d as *Teylu a [oel yerom tsat] lu ftx\u00eclor, that is, \u2018The teylu that [I\u2019m eating it] is delicious.\u2019 In both Na\u2019vi and English, you must delete the \u201cit\u201d in the bracketed clause (a \u201crelative clause\u201d for the grammarians in the audience). But even though the object has been deleted from that clause, the agentive marking remains.\n\nOn a personal note:\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve given a public talk about Na\u2019vi, but I have two such events coming up in April, both in California. The first is at California Polytechnic State University (aka Cal Poly) in San Luis Obispo, about halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, the evening of April 5<sup>th</sup>:\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://theforumatpoly.com/upcoming-forums\">http://theforumatpoly.com/upcoming-forums</a>\n\n\n\nThe second talk is two weeks later at my alma mater USC, here in Los Angeles, on April 19<sup>th</sup>.

Look what happens when you have a coordinate structure:\n\n\nAs you see, the A-structure allows you to be somewhat more concise.\n\n\n**sna\u2019o **(n., SNA.\u2019o) \u2018set, group, pile, clump, stand\u2019\n\n\n\nNote: **Sna\u2019o** is nfp\u2014not for people. For a group of people, use **pongu**.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about **sna\u2019o** is that it has an abbreviated form, **sna-**, which functions as a noun prefix to indicate a group or collection. With living things other than people, **sna-** is productive\u2014you can use it to indicate a group of any plant or animal: **snanantang** \u2018a pack of viperwolves,\u2019 **snatalioang** \u2018a herd of sturmbeest,\u2019 **snautral** \u2018a stand of trees,\u2019 etc. These words are not listed in the dictionary.\n\n\n\nHowever, in all other cases **sna**&#8211; is not productive, and you\u2019re not free to form your own words with this prefix. The meanings of such **sna**&#8211; words can be unpredictable, and so they have to be listed in the dictionary. For example:\n\n\n\n**snatx\u00e4rem** (n., sna.TX\u00c4.rem) \u2018skeleton\u2019 (lit.: \u2018a set of bones\u2019)\n\n\n\n**snafp\u00eclfya** (n., sna.FP\u00ccL.fya) \u2018philosophy\u2019 (lit.: \u2018a group of mindsets\u2019)\n\n\n\n**snatanh\u00ec** (n., sna.tan.H\u00cc) \u2018constellation\u2019 (lit.: \u2018a clump of stars\u2019)\n\n\n\nOne more thing to note about **sna**&#8211; words: they indicate **naturally occurring** groups or sets. For example, a **snasyulang** is a patch of flowers growing naturally on the ground or on a tree branch. Contrast that with a **s\u00e4stars\u00ecm syulang\u00e4**, a collection of flowers selected and put together intentionally by a person\u2014that is, a bouquet.\n\n\n\n**s\u00e4stars\u00ecm** (n., s\u00e4.STAR.s\u00ecm) \u2018collection (put together intentionally by a person)\u2019\n\n\n\n**tsu\u2019o** (n., TSU.\u2019o) \u2018ability\u2019\n\n\n\nLike **sna\u2019o**, the most useful thing about **tsu\u2019o** is its abbreviated form. In this case it\u2019s &#8211;**tswo**, which is a suffix for verbs that changes the verb to a noun indicating the ability to perform the action of the verb. The great thing about **\u2013tswo** is that it\u2019s productive: you can add it to practically any verb. For example: **tarontswo** \u2018ability to hunt,\u2019 **wemtswo** \u2018ability to fight,\u2019 **roltswo** \u2018ability to sing,\u2019 etc.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to try to equate \u2013**tswo** with English **\u2013able/-ible**\u2014after all, they\u2019re both suffixes having to do with ability. But there\u2019s a big difference. For example, **inantswo** means the ability **to read**; it is not equivalent to English \u2018readable,\u2019 which is the ability **to be read**. For that, recall that Na\u2019vi prefixes **tsuk**&#8211; to form adjectives: **tsukinana pamrel** \u2018readable writing.\u2019\n\n\n\nOne little wrinkle: We indicated that \u2013**tswo** is attached only to verbs. That\u2019s true except in the case of **si**-constructions. With **si**-verbs, drop the **si** and attach \u2013**tswo** to the non-verbal element: **srungtswo** \u2018ability to help,\u2019 **pamreltswo** \u2018ability to write,\u2019 **tstutswo** \u2018ability to close.\u2019\n\n\n\n*I\u2019ve just become aware that **krra** is not in our official dictionary. It\u2019s in my own database, but I guess I forgot to publicize it. **Krra** is the __conjunction__ \u2018when\u2019:\n\n\n\n**krra** (conj., KRR.a) \u2018when, at the time that\u2019\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nDon\u2019t use **tsakrr** for this purpose. **Tsakrr** is an __adverb__, not a conjunction, meaning \u2018then\u2019 or \u2018at that time.\u2019 It\u2019s often used with **txo**: **txo . . . tsakrr**, \u2018**if . . . then**.\u2019\n\n\n\nThe spelling convention **krr a**, as two words, is not incorrect, but **krra** is preferred. With the reverse clause order, however, **a krr** is the correct spelling. This mirrors the convention with **a f\u00ec\u2019u**.\n\n\n\nA note on stress: In keeping with the general rule, **sna**&#8211; and \u2013**tswo** do not affect the stress of the word they\u2019re attached to: **tanH\u00cc**, **snatanH\u00cc**; **TAron**, **TArontswo**.\n\n\n\n**K\u00ecyevame vay vospx\u00ecay!**\n\n\n", "new vocabulary": ["**syeha** (n., SYE.ha) \u2018breath\u2019", "**syeha si** (vin.) \u2018breathe\u2019", "**sko** (ADP+) \u2018as, in the capacity of, in the role of\u2019", "**snatx\u00e4rem** (n., sna.TX\u00c4.rem) \u2018skeleton\u2019 (lit.: \u2018a set of bones\u2019", "**snafp\u00eclfya** (n., sna.FP\u00ccL.fya) \u2018philosophy\u2019 (lit.: \u2018a group of mindsets\u2019", "**snatanh\u00ec** (n., sna.tan.H\u00cc) \u2018constellation\u2019 (lit.: \u2018a clump of stars\u2019", "**s\u00e4stars\u00ecm** (n., s\u00e4.STAR.s\u00ecm) \u2018collection (put together intentionally by a person)\u2019", "**tsu\u2019o** (n., TSU.\u2019o) \u2018ability\u2019", "**krra** (conj., KRR.a) \u2018when, at the time that\u2019"], "tags": ["vocabulary", "discussion"]}, "Spring Vocabulary, Part 3": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2012/06/spring-vocabulary-part-3/", "content": "**\nKaltx\u00ec, ma eylan. \u2019Ok oey\u00e4 lu ayngar srak? <img src=\"Naviteri/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":-)\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />\n**\n** Furia txankrr f\u00ectsengit ke tarmok, oeru txoa livu.**\n\n\n\nSince it\u2019s still a couple of days until the Summer Solstice, we\u2019ll can call this Spring Vocabulary, Part 3. **Irayo**, as always, to the hardworking and extremely patient LEP folks and all the rest of you who have contributed ideas.\n\n\n\n**\n\nftxul\u00ec\u2019u\n** (vin., ftxu.L\u00cc.\u2019u\u2014inf. 1,1) \u2018orate, give a speech\u2019\n\n\n\nThe etymology of this word goes back to **t\u00e4ftxu** \u2018weave\u2019 + **l\u00ec\u2019u** \u2018word,\u2019 the original thought being that to give a speech is to weave words together.\n\n\nDerivations:\n\n\n**ftxul\u00ec\u2019uyu** (n., ftxu.L\u00cc.\u2019u.yu) \u2018orator, (public) speaker\u2019\n\n\n\n**s\u00e4ftxul\u00ec\u2019u** (n., s\u00e4.ftxu.L\u00cc.\u2019u) \u2018speech, oration\u2019\n\n\n\n**t\u00ecftxul\u00ec\u2019u** (n., t\u00ec.ftxu.L\u00cc.\u2019u) \u2018speech-making, public speaking)\n\n\n\n**slantire** (n., slan.ti.RE) \u2018inspiration\u2019\n\n\n\nEtymology: **slan** \u2018support\u2019 + **tirea** \u2018spirit\u2019\n\n\nDerivation:\n\n\n**slantire si** (vin.) \u2018inspire\u2019\n\n\n\n**kum** (n.) \u2018result\u2019\n\n\n\nThe importance of **kum** lies in the derived conjunctions **kuma/akum**, which are used in result clauses:\n\n\n\n**kuma / akum** (conj., KUM.a / a.KUM) \u2018that (as a result)\u2019\n\n\n\nNote a couple of things there. First, **n\u00ecftxan** and **f\u00ectxan** are used interchangeably as the equivalent of English \u2018so\u2019 in these sentences. Second, the difference between **kuma** and **akum** is that **kuma** precedes the result while **akum** follows it. So another form of the previous example sentence is:\n\n\nSuch a structure is rather marginal in English, although you sometimes hear it in poetry: \u201cI fell in love with her, so beautiful was she.\u201d\n\n\nAnd notice one more thing: the word order in result clauses is somewhat constrained. The rule is that **kuma/akum** must be **contiguous** with **niftxan/f\u00ectxan**.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that the short form **tsane** \u2018there\u2019 is used with verbs of motion: it\u2019s the place **to which** one goes. The full form is **tsatsengne**.\n\n\n\nA final note on **kuma/akum**: These words may be used independently of **f\u00ectxan/n\u00ecftxan**:\n\n\n\nUsed in this way, **kuma/akum** overlap somewhat with **ha** \u2018so\u2019.\n\n\n\n**fyel** (vtr.) \u2018seal, cement, make impervious\u2019\n\n\nThis word signifies making something tight and secure, so that it is unlikely (or at least not intended) to be broken, whether it refers to a hole in a boat\u2019s bottom, a food container to be stored, or a wound from a viperwolf tooth.\n\n\n**Fyel**, however, is not used in the sense of bringing something to completion. For that, use **hasey si **\u2018complete\u2019:\n\n\n\n**zey** (adj.) \u2018special, distinct\u2019\n\n\n\n**Zey**, **keteng**, and **le\u2019aw** all indicate that one thing is different from another. Of the three, **keteng** \u2018not the same\u2019 is the most neutral; **le\u2019aw** \u2018only, sole\u2019 is the strongest.\n\n\n\n**vll** (vin., vtr.) \u2018indicate, point at\u2019\n\n\n\nBoth **eykyu** and **eyktan** mean leader; the difference is one of scope and responsibility. An **eykyu** is the often temporary leader of a small group, for example the person in charge of a hunting party; an **eyktan** is a higher and more permanent position, the representative leader of a sub-community within the clan. The **Olo\u2019eyktan**, of course, leads the entire clan.\n\n\n\nGetting back to **vll**, note that some of the inflected forms have special spellings. The &lt;ol&gt; form is **vol** (compare **poltxe** from **plltxe**), and the \u201cpositively oriented\u201d &lt;ei&gt; form is **veiyll**. That\u2019s because a syllable cannot begin with **ll** or **rr**.\n\n\n\n**Vll** can also be used metaphorically in the case of one thing, not necessarily animate, pointing to or indicating another:\n\n\n\n**am\u2019ake** (adj., am.\u2019A.ke) \u2018sure, confident\u2019\n\n\n\nThis word is related to **am\u2019a** \u2018doubt\u2019 in roughly the same way that **kxuke** \u2018safe\u2019 is related to **kxu** \u2018harm.\u2019 It\u2019s used with **\u2019efu**:\n\n\nDerivation:\n\n\n**nam\u2019ake** (adv., nam.\u2019A.ke) \u2018confidently\u2019\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t confuse **nam\u2019ake** with **am\u2019aluke **(am.\u2019A.lu.ke), \u2018without a doubt\u2019\u2014although both are adverbial expressions, they\u2019re used in different ways. **Nam\u2019ake** is a **manner adverbial**\u2014that is, it qualifies **how** something is done. In the above example, it indicates **the manner in which** Akwey spoke to Tuke. **Am\u2019aluke**, on the other hand, is a **sentence adverbial**\u2014it represents the **speaker\u2019s feeling** about what he or she is saying:\n\n\nAnd speaking of sentence adverbials, here\u2019s a word I think you\u2019ll find useful:\n\n\n**kezemplltxe **(adv., ke.zem.pll.TXE) \u2018of course, needless to say\u2019\n\n\n\nAs you\u2019ve probably guessed, it\u2019s a contraction of **ke zene pivlltxe** \u2018not necessary to say.\u2019\n\n\n\n**tare** (vtr., TA.re\u2014inf. 1,2) \u2018connect, relate to, have a relationship with\u2019\n\n\n\n(Question: Which syllable in **tolar\u00e4nge** should be stressed? <img src=\"Naviteri/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":-)\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />  )\n\n\nDerivation:\n\n\n**s\u00e4tare** (n., s\u00e4.TA.re) \u2018connection, relationship\u2019\n\n\nAlso note the following useful conversational expression:\n\n\n**sloa **(adj., SLO.a) \u2018wide\u2019\n\n\n\n**snep** (adj.) \u2018narrow\u2019\n\n\nDerivation:\n\n\n**slosnep** (n., slo.SNEP) \u2018width\u2019\n\n\n\n**peslosnep** (q., pe.slo.SNEP) or **slosneppe** (slo.SNE.pe) \u2018what width? how wide?\u2019\n\n\n\n**hoet** (adj., HO.et) \u2018vast, broad, expansive\u2019\n\n\nDerivation:\n\n\n**n\u00echoet** (adv., n\u00ec.HO.et) \u2018widely, pervasively\u2019\n\n\n\n**so\u2019ha** (vtr., SO\u2019.ha\u2014inf. 1,2) \u2018be enthusiastic about, show enthusiasm for, be excited about\u2019\n\n\nNote that in Na\u2019vi, being enthusiastic is transitive.\n\nThis word can also be used on its own as an interjection:\n\nDerivations:\n\n\n**t\u00ecso\u2019ha** (n.)  \u2018enthusiasm; having a good attitude\u2019\n\n\n\n**n\u00ecso\u2019ha **(adv.)  \u2018enthusiastically\u2019\n\n\n\n**leso\u2019ha** (adj.)  \u2018enthusiastic, keen\u2019 **(only for persons)**\n\n\n\nOn a personal note, John and I are leaving on Friday for <a href=\"http://seticon.com/\">SETIcon II</a>, the annual SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) conference being held in Santa Clara, California.

Instead, **ha\u2019** can take either a plural (or dual or trial) subject with **f\u00ectsap** \u2018each other\u2019 or the dative.\n\n\n\n**syon** (n.) \u2018feature, trait, attribute, characteristic, point, aspect, facet, property\u2019\n\n\n\n**ran** (n.) \u2018intrinsic character or nature, essence, constitution\u2019\n\n\n\nThis word has no exact English equivalent.

More specifically:\n\n\n\nNote: The last two expressions do not mean \u2018room that eats\u2019 and \u2018room that sleeps,\u2019 although theoretically they could!

Later, it occurred to me that this could be a fun little contest for members of the **l\u00ec\u2019fyaolo\u2019**: come up with a Na&#8217;vi haiku, which I will use for my interview, **kezemplltxe** with proper acknowledgment of the author!\n\n\nFor those of you who might not be familiar with haiku, it&#8217;s a form of brief poetry of Japanese origin.

The subject is often related to the natural world.\n\nHere&#8217;s a (not very good) English example I just made up.

Then I&#8217;ll find out who the author is so I can acknowledge her or him when I read the poem on camera.\n\nSince my interview is Tuesday afternoon, please submit your haikus no later than Monday at noon, Pacific Time.

I was genuinely impressed\u2014and touched\u2014by the effort and creativity that went into the submissions. Deciding on the winner wasn\u2019t easy.\n\n\nHere\u2019s how I proceeded. First, I copied all 30+ poems into a separate document, completely anonymously, and printed it out. Then I went through each one carefully. I found myself writing Nice! in the margins many times, and Lovely! more than once. A few had minor grammatical problems, so I eliminated those from consideration. But I was still left with a large and wonderful collection. Most touched on nature, especially the images of falling leaves and approaching cold. Some seemed spiritual. Others were mysterious and thought-provoking. At least one related to the plot of Avatar. And many made me smile.\n\nAlthough, as I say, the choice was difficult, in the end I chose this haiku for the purpose of today\u2019s interview:\n\nThe author\u2019s translation is:\n\n\n(**M\u00ecftxele**, notice that the English is a bona fide haiku itself!)\n\n\n\nI especially liked this one for several reasons. It sounds great; the second line is the shortest of all but contains the most syllables (**s\u00eclronsem n\u00ecngay, kefyak**?); it\u2019s upbeat; and I won\u2019t have too much trouble memorizing it.  <img src=\"Naviteri/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":-)\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />\n\n\n\n**Seykxel s\u00ec nitram** to the author, Prrton!\n\n\n\nAnd congratulations to **everyone** who participated.

It\u2019s an excellent framework for clarifying and summarizing the Na\u2019vi expressions relating to perception.\n\n\n\n**inanfya** (n., i.NAN.fya) \u2018sense (means of perception)\u2019\n\n\n\n**Inanfya** (from **inan** \u2018read, gain knowledge from sensory input\u2019 + **fya\u2019o** \u2018path, way\u2019) covers the five senses the Na\u2019vi share with us: sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. Whether there are other **inanfya** unique to the Na\u2019vi (for example, perception of magnetism) is a matter for further investigation. In what follows we\u2019ll just deal with the five familiar senses.\n\n\nThe following table sums up the necessary vocabulary, some of which is already familiar and some of which will be new to you:\n\nFirst some details of the new vocabulary:\n\n\n**hefi** (vtr., HE.fi\u2014inf. 1,2) \u2018smell (-control)\u2019\n\n\n\n**ewku** (vtr., EW.ku\u2014inf. 1,2) \u2018taste (-control)\u2019\n\n\n\n**z\u00ecm** (vtr.) \u2018feel (-control)\u2019\n\n\n\n**yune** (vtr., YU.ne\u2014inf. 1,2) \u2018listen to (+control)\u2019\n\n\n\n**syam** (vtr.) \u2018smell (+control)\u2019\n\n\n\n**\u2019ur** (n.) \u2018sight, look, appearance\u2019\n\n\n\n**sur** (n.) \u2018taste, flavor\u2019\n\n\n\n**zir** (n.) \u2018touch, feel, texture\u2019\n\n\n\nThe \u201cability\u201d nouns consist of the \u2013control verbs with the addition of **\u2013tswo**; an exception is **ewktswo**, where the unstressed **u** has dropped.\n\n\n\n**tse\u2019atswo** (n., tse.\u2019A.tswo) \u2018(sense of) sight, vision\u2019\n\n\n\n**stawmtswo** (n., STAWM.tswo) \u2018(sense of) hearing\u2019\n\n\n\n**hefitswo** (n., HE.fi.tswo) \u2018sense of smell\u2019\n\n\n\n**ewktswo** (n., EWK.tswo) \u2018sense of taste\u2019\n\n\n\n**z\u00ecmtswo** (n.,  Z\u00ccM.tswo) \u2018sense of touch\u2019\n\n\nNow for some explanation of the table entries.\n\nAs you see, the expressions in the first three columns are verbs, and in the fourth and fifth nouns. Let\u2019s look first at the verbs.\n\n\n**\n__\u2013control vs. +control__\n**\n\n\n\n****Many languages distinguish between perceptions that occur without your control (for example, \u201csee\u201d and \u201chear\u201d in English) which we\u2019re calling \u201c\u2014control\u201d vs. perceptions that you initiate yourself (like \u201clook\u201d and \u201clisten\u201d) which we call +control. If you heard a bird singing, you had no choice in the matter: the external stimulus, in this case sound, came to your ears without your control and created an internal sensory experience. But if you listened to the bird, you made a deliberate choice to focus your attention on the stimulus. Unlike English, Na\u2019vi makes this distinction in **all** the sensory modalities.\n\n\nExamples of the VTRs\u2014the transitive verbs:\n\n\n*\nsight\n*\n\n\n\n*\nhearing\n*\n\n\n\n*\nsmell\n*\n\n\n\n*\ntaste\n*\n\n\n\n*\ntouch\n*\n\n\n\n(In the last example, note that **r\u00e4\u2019\u00e4** \u2018don\u2019t\u2019 can come after the verb for special emphasis.)\n\n\n\nA note on **may\u2019**: Its original meaning, as you see in the table, is the control-form of \u2018taste\u2019\u2014that is, \u2018check out something by tasting.\u2019 Its use expanded to include \u201cchecking out\u201d almost anything, and not just by taste\u2014as the dictionary says, \u2018try, sample, evaluate, test-drive.\u2019 So you can **may\u2019** a fruit, an article of clothing, a new way of holding your bow, etc.\n\n\n\nAs for the two +control forms in the second and third columns, the simple verbs in column 2 are used **mostly** with an explicit object, while the **t\u00ecng** forms are used **mostly** without an object. So the most common way to say \u2018Look at that!\u2019 is **N\u00ecn tsat!** But if you just want to say \u2018Look!\u2019 it\u2019s usually **T\u00ecng nari!** But other possibilities exist. So, for example, to say \u2018Look at him!\u2019 the most common way is simply **Poti n\u00ecn!** But **Poru t\u00ecng nari!** is also possible.\n\n\n\nThe last two columns in the table are self-explanatory. The \u201cnouns of sensation\u201d are the sensations related to the verbs in the first two columns. So, for example, you **stawm** or **yune** a **pam**\u2014that is, you hear or listen to a sound. And the words ending in **-tswo** are the abilities related to the senses. For example:\n\n\n\n**\n__Middle Voice__\n**\n\n\nWhen we say things in English like \u201cThis tastes good,\u201d \u201cThat feels smooth,\u201d \u201cThis fish smells awful,\u201d \u201cHe looks like a warrior,\u201d we\u2019re using what\u2019s been called \u201cmiddle voice.\u201d How do we say such things in Na\u2019vi?\n\n\n\u201cMiddle voice\u201d constructions in Na\u2019vi use the intransitive verb **fkan**, which has no simple equivalent in English and is difficult to translate by itself:\n\n\n\n**fkan** (vin.) \u2018resemble in a sensory modality, come to the senses as\u2019\n\n\n\nBut some examples will make it clear how to use **fkan**:\n\n\n\nNote that **fkan** behaves syntactically like **lu** and **lam**\u2014that is, it\u2019s intransitive. Also, both **sur** and **oeru** in the above example are optional. If you omit **oeru**, you\u2019re making a general statement: not that the drink tastes sweet **to you**, but that it tastes sweet, period\u2014that is, to everyone. If you omit **sur**, the sentence is grammatical but ambiguous, since you\u2019re not specifying the sensory modality: the drink could **taste** sweet, but it could also **smell** sweet. It\u2019s safe to omit the noun of sensation if the context makes it clear. Or in some cases you might want to be deliberately ambiguous.\n\n\nIn the second example, we don\u2019t know if Rini\u2019s hair looks beautiful, feels beautiful, or smells beautiful.\n\n\nFor expressions like \u201clooks like,\u201d \u201cfeels like,\u201d etc., we use **fkan** along with **na** or **pxel**. Example:\n\n\n\nFinally, here are a few sense adjectives, some of which are new, that you can use along with **fkan**:\n\n\n\nAs you know, we have the adjectives **lor** and **v\u00e4\u2019**, which mean \u201cpleasant/unpleasant to the senses,\u201d respectively. (Note that we use **lor** for sensory impression rather than **s\u00ecltsan**.) These words can be used for **any** of the senses\u2014that is, something can be pleasing in touch, taste, smell, what have you.  In addition, for the sense of taste we have the specific words **ftx\u00eclor **\u2018good-tasting\u2019** **and** ftx\u00ecv\u00e4\u2019 **\u2018bad-tasting\u2019. So for \u201cThis drink tastes good,\u201d we can say either **F\u00ecnaer\u00ecri sur fkan lor** or **F\u00ecnaer\u00ecri fkan ftx\u00eclor**.\n\n\nAlso:\n\n\n**onlor** (adj., on.LOR) \u2018good-smelling\u2019\n\n\n\n**onv\u00e4\u2019** (adj., on.V\u00c4\u2019) \u2018bad-smelling\u2019\n\n\nHere are the primary \u201ctaste\u201d adjectives:\n\n\n**kalin **(adj., ka.LIN) \u2018sweet\u2019\n\n\n\n**sy\u00e4\u2019\u00e4** (adj., SY\u00c4.\u2019\u00e4) bitter\n\n\n\n**we\u2019ay** (adj., WE.\u2019ay) \u2018sour\u2019\n\n\n\n**wip **(adj.) \u2018salty\u2019\n\n\n\n**fwang** (adj.) \u2018savory, **umami**, rich\u2019\n\n\nNote that these words can be used to describe smells as well as tastes.

But if you encounter a *tsim*-compound you haven\u2019t seen before, you should be able to guess its meaning pretty accurately.\n\n\nWith these forms, we have a second syntactic structure to express ideas like worry, confusion, and mystery:\n\nThese mean essentially the same thing. A literal translation of A into clumsy English would be, \u201cI have a feeling of worry that he didn\u2019t come.\u201d B would be: \u201cIt\u2019s a source of worry to me that he didn\u2019t come.\u201d\n\n\nOne advantage of the *\u2013tsim* forms is that they allow you to make general statements without specifying the experiencer:\n\n\nDerivations:\n\n\n**ingyentsy\u00ecp** (n., ING.yen.tsy\u00ecp) \u2018trick, sleight of hand, clever/special methodology\u2019\n\n\n\nThis word should properly be *ingyentsimtsy\u00ecp*, but it evolved naturally to the shorter form and is always used that way.\n\n\n\n**ningyen** (adv., NING.yen) \u2018mysteriously, in a puzzling fashion\u2019\n\n\n\nThis adverb is obviously a contraction of *n\u00ec* + *ingyen*.\n\n\n\n**ingyenga\u2019** (adj., ING.ye.nga\u2019) \u2018mysterious, puzzling, enigmatic\u2019\n\n\n\nThis word evolved from *ingyentsim* + *nga\u2019* , i.e. \u2018containing a source of mystery.\u2019 As in *ingyentsy\u00ecp*, however, the *tsim* part dropped over time, and then *ingyen* + *nga\u2019* became simply *ingyenga\u2019*.\n\n\n\nParallel to *ingyenga\u2019* we also have:\n\n\n\n**sngunga\u2019** (adj., SNGU.nga\u2019) \u2018worrisome, troubling\u2019\n\n\n\n**yayayrnga\u2019** (adj., ya.YAYR.nga\u2019) \u2018confusing\u2019\n\n\n\nNote: This word is often pronounced colloquially as *yayaynga\u2019*, although in writing the *r* is retained.\n\n\n\n**yrr** (adj.) \u2018wild, natural\u2019\n\n\n\n*Yrr* refers to something in its original, unmodified, untampered-with natural state. As such, it has various translations, depending on the context.\n\n\nDerivation:\n\n\n**n\u00ecyrr** (adv., n\u00ec.YRR) \u2018naturally, without tampering with or changing the nature\u2019\n\n\n\nThe opposite of *yrr* is:\n\n\n\n**z\u00e4fi** (adj., Z\u00c4.fi) \u2018modified, interfered with, no longer in a natural state\u2019\n\n\n\n*Z\u00e4fi *does not specify *how* the natural state of something has been interfered with, only that it\u2019s no longer in its original state. The nature of the modification depends on context.\n\n\n\nHere, talking about food, the usual interpretation of \u201cno longer in its natural state\u201d is \u201ccooked.\u201d If you wanted to be more specific, you could of course say *tsnganit a\u2019awnem*.\n\n\n\n**syor** (vin.) \u2018relax, chill out\u2019\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n**t\u00ecfnunga\u2019** (adj., t\u00ec.FNU.nga\u2019) \u2018quiet (nfp)\u2019\n\n\n\nAlso, notice in the above example how *speng* \u2018restore\u2019 has been used metaphorically: *sp\u00e4peng* = \u2018restore oneself,\u2019 that is, \u2018get one\u2019s head back on straight.\u2019\n\n\n\n**t\u00ecsyor** (n., t\u00ec.SYOR) \u2018relaxation\u2019\n\n\n\n**\u2019anla** (vtr., \u2019AN.la\u2014inf. 1,2) \u2018yearn for\u2019\n\n\n\n**s\u00e4\u2019anla** (n., s\u00e4.\u2019AN.la) \u2018yearning\u2019\n\n\n\n**lie** (n., LI.e) \u2018experience\u2019\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve already seen *lie* as part of the important adverb *\u2019awlie*, which we\u2019ve glossed as \u2018once (experiential).\u2019 When used in yes-no questions, *\u2019awlie* is best translated as \u2018ever.\u2019\n\n\nWe now have two ways of talking about having the experience of doing something:\n\n\nThese both mean, \u2018I once ate *teylu*.\u2019 B, however, is somewhat more formal than A.\n\n\n\nBy the way, don\u2019t confuse *\u2019awlie* and *\u2019awlo*. Although they both mean \u2018once,\u2019 *\u2019awlie* refers simply to having an experience, while *\u2019awlo* emphasizes that the experience occurred once and once only, not twice (*melo*) or thrice (*pxelo*).\n\n\nAnd now for some expressions involving \u2018hope\u2019:\n\n\n**ts\u00eclpey** (n., ts\u00ecl.PEY) \u2018hope (abstract idea)\u2019\n\n\n\nThis derived from original **t\u00ecs\u00eclpey*.\n\n\n\n**s\u00e4s\u00eclpey** (n., s\u00e4.s\u00ecl.PEY) \u2018hope (particular instance)\u2019\n\n\n\nOne derivative of *s\u00eclpey* that you already know is *n\u00ecs\u00eclpey*, \u2018hopefully.\u2019 This word requires some explanation, since we also have the word *n\u00ecrangal*, glossed as \u2018I wish; oh that.\u2019 What\u2019s the difference between *n\u00ecrangal* and *n\u00ecs\u00eclpey*?\n\n\n\nBoth words are used with the subjunctive, but there\u2019s a semantic distinction. *N\u00ecs\u00eclpey* simply expresses a hope that something is true. The speaker doesn\u2019t know what the truth is, but hopes that something is, was, or will be the case.\n\n\n\nWith *n\u00ecrangal*, though, the speaker knows that something is not the case but wishes it were. (For those who like fancy grammatical terminology, *n\u00ecrangal* is used for counterfactuals.)\n\n\n\n(If you find any of this confusing, I have to admit I once confused the two words myself. In my post of July 24, 2011, I wrote *n\u00ecrangal z\u00ecs\u00ectay* when I meant *n\u00ecs\u00eclpey z\u00ecs\u00ectay*, \u2018hopefully next year.\u2019 I\u2019ve since corrected the error.)\n\n\n\nOne more thing: *n\u00ecs\u00eclpey* (but not *n\u00ecrangal*) can function as a manner adverbial as well as a sentence adverbial\u2014that is, it can mean \u2018in a hopeful way.\u2019 (Roughly speaking, manner adverbials tell you how things are done; sentence adverbials allow the speaker to comment about what she or he is saying. If I say, \u201cObviously Carlson stole the money,\u201d I\u2019m saying that it\u2019s obvious\u2014to me or anyone else\u2014that Carlson was the thief. That\u2019s using \u201cobviously\u201d as a sentence adverbial. But if I say, \u201cCarlson stole the money obviously,\u201d I\u2019m saying that he did it in an obvious way\u2014he didn\u2019t hide the theft. For some reason he wanted people to see him doing it. That\u2019s using \u201cobviously\u201d as a manner adverbial.)\n\n\nA NOTE ON CASE ENDINGS WITH DIPHTHONGS\n\n\nAs you know, Na\u2019vi has four diphthongs: *aw*, *ay*, *ew*, *ey*. If a noun ends in a diphthong, there are a few things to keep in mind with some of the case endings.\n\n\nThe t-case for objects (also known as the patientive case):\n\n\nWith nouns ending in *ey*, the *-it* ending becomes simply *t*. Example: *keyeyt* \u2018errors\u2019 (not **keyeyit*). With nouns ending in *ay*, the *\u2013it* ending *may* become *t*: *wayt*  or *wayit* \u2018song\u2019\u2014both forms are possible. For the other two diphthongs, the *\u2013it* ending does not change: *fahewit* \u2018smell,\u2019 *\u2019etnawit* \u2018shoulder.\u2019\n\n\n\nFor all four diphthongs, the *ti-* form is also possible: *keyeyti*, *wayti*, *fahewti, \u2019etnawti*.\n\n\nThe r-case for indirect objects (also known as the dative case):\n\n\nWith nouns ending in *ew*, the *-ur* ending becomes simply *r*. Example: *fahewr* \u2018to/for a smell\u2019 (not **fahewur*). With nouns ending in *aw*, the *\u2013ur* ending *may* become *r*: *\u2019etnawr *or *\u2019etnawur *\u2018to/for a shoulder\u2019\u2014both forms are possible. For the other two diphthongs, the *\u2013ur* ending does not change: *keyeyur* \u2018to/for errors,\u2019 *wayur* \u2018to/for a song.\u2019\n\n\n\nFor all four diphthongs, the *ru-* form is also possible: *keyeyru*, *wayru*, *fahewru, \u2019etnawru*.\n\n\n\nIn closing, I want to say that I\u2019m really looking forward to attending the Euroavatar meet-up in Berlin! For the last two years I was there via Skype, but this year John and I will be there in person. It should be wonderful!

That structure, of course, is transitive:\n\n\nLiterally, the sentence above is saying, \u201cAs for language, what level does she occupy?\u201d\n\n\nThat, by the way, is how it\u2019s said on Pandora, since there, \u201clanguage\u201d means \u201cthe Na\u2019vi language.\u201d *M\u00ec \u2019Rrta*, however, that could be confusing, since there are many languages we could be asking about. So it\u2019s often best to say, *\u201cL\u00ec\u2019fyari leNa\u2019vi pol tok pey\u00ect?\u201d*\n\n\n\nThe second structure is intransitive: you *stand on* a certain level:\n\n\n\n*Kllkxem s\u00ecn* is the general expression for standing on anything\u2014a ledge, rock, hill, etc. Note that the common phrase *s\u00ecn pey\u00ec* is pronounced as if it were spelled *s\u00ecm pey\u00ec*, although the *n* doesn\u2019t change in writing.\n\n\n\nThe previous example is somewhat formal; in speech, there are two informal variants. First, *kllkxem* may be dropped:\n\n\n\nAnd in even less formal situations, *s\u00ecn* may be dropped as well:\n\n\n\nIn all of these, however, *kllkxem s\u00ecn* is understood.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with some examples of questions and answers using *y\u00ec*.\n\n\nFirst note the following compounds:\n\n\n**kxayly\u00ec** (n., KXAYL.y\u00ec) \u2018high level\u2019\n\n\n\n**kxamy\u00ec** (n., KXAM.y\u00ec) \u2018intermediate level\u2019\n\n\n\n**t\u00ecmy\u00ec** (n., T\u00ccM.y\u00ec) \u2018low level\u2019\n\n\n\nThe above example is important to understand. The question is, what\u2019s the *a f\u00ec\u2019u* doing there? (With the other way of saying it, *Fwa fol fnan futa \u2019em teylut s\u00ecn pey\u00ec?* the question is similar: Why do we need the *fwa* (= *f\u00ec\u2019u a*)?) The answer is that with *pey\u00ec*, the metaphorical idea of standing on a particular level is still very strong. If *kllkxem* or both *kllkxem* and *s\u00ecn* are omitted, which they may be, they nevertheless remain as \u201cunderstood,\u201d and it must be possible to put them back into the sentence. Something has to be standing on the level, and that something is *f\u00ec\u2019u*, modified appropriately with *a* and a clause.

With special emphasis, it\u2019s the usual expression for placing blame:\n\n\n\nAdditionally, *nui* gives us the important adverb *n\u00ecnu*, which is difficult to translate into English.

Eywa ayngahu n\u00ecwotx.*\n\n\n", "new vocabulary": [], "tags": ["news"]}, "Zun . . . Zel: Counterfactual Conditionals": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2013/04/zun-zel-counterfactual-conditionals/", "content": "*Kaltx\u00ec, ma eylan\u2014*\n\n\n\n*F\u00ecpost\u00ec mektsengur teya si*. This post fills a gap in our understanding of Na\u2019vi syntax: counterfactual conditionals. The counterfactual structure is a bit complicated, so we\u2019ll go slow, and if necessary, we\u2019ll have further clarifications in subsequent posts.\n\n\n\nFirst, some terminology. What is a conditional sentence? Simply one in \u201cif \u2026 then\u201d form. For example, \u201cIf you build it, they will come.\u201d In such sentences, the \u201cif\u201d part specifying the condition is called the hypothesis (or if you want to be very fancy, the *protasis*); the \u201cthen\u201d part is the consequence (or *apodosis*). But there\u2019s no reason for us not to stick to the simple terms \u201cif-part\u201d and \u201cthen-part.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re very familiar with the most frequent words for \u2018if-then,\u2019 *txo* and *tsakrr*. *Txo ngal tsat txivula, (tsakrr) fo zaya\u2019u*. (*Tsakrr* is often omitted.) But there\u2019s another pair of words for if-then: *zun* and *zel* respectively. They\u2019re used for counterfactual conditionals\u2014that is, for if-then sentences where you\u2019re talking about something that *didn\u2019t* happen or *isn\u2019t* the case.\n\n\nFor example, compare these two sentences:\n\n\n(1)\n<audio controls=\"controls\" preload=\"none\">\n<source src=\"Naviteri/01-Txo-zivup.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\" />\n</audio>\n\n**\nTxo zivup tompa, (tsakrr) ke tsun oe kiv\u00e4.\n**       \u2018If it\u2019s raining, (then) I can\u2019t go.\u2019\n\n\n\n(2)\n<audio controls=\"controls\" preload=\"none\">\n<source src=\"Naviteri/02-Zun-zivup.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\" />\n</audio>\n\n**Zun****\nzivup tompa, zel ke tsivun oe kiv\u00e4.\n**       \u2018If it were raining, (then) I couldn\u2019t go.\u2019\n\n\n\nIn (1), I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s raining or not\u2014maybe it is, maybe it isn\u2019t. (I haven\u2019t looked out the window.) If it *is* raining, then I can\u2019t go. (Usual implication: If it\u2019s not raining, I can go.) In (2), however, it is *not* currently raining. If it *were* raining, then I couldn\u2019t go. But it\u2019s not. (Usual implication: Therefore, I can go.) So (2) is talking about a hypothetical situation that we know to be untrue\u2014that is, a *counterfactual* situation.\n\n\n\nTo understand the counterfactual system, note two things: first, you always use *zun* and *zel* for \u2018if-then\u2019 (unlike *tsakrr*, *zel* cannot be omitted); second, the verb forms are in the subjunctive\u2014that is, they take the various infixes that contain *v*. There are 5 such infixes, each built on the pattern -i_v-:\n\n\nSo those are the tools we have to work with. Now let\u2019s look at both sentence parts in turn:\n\n\n**\n__The \u2018if\u2019 part__\n**\n\n\nA. Something that is not presently the case:\n\n\nFor these situations, we use either the simplest form of the subjunctive infix, &#8211;*iv*-, or the &#8211;*irv*&#8211; form to indicate ongoing action.\n\n\nB. Something that was not the case in the past:\n\n\nFor these situations, we use either &#8211;*imv*&#8211; (if the past nature of the action is the most important thing) or &#8211;*ilv*&#8211; (if the emphasis is on the completion of the action). Often the choice between the two is arbitrary. Note that in counterfactuals there\u2019s no special form for ongoing action in the past; you just have to tell it from the context. So *Zun oe timvaron* means either \u2018If I had hunted\u2019 or \u2018If I had been hunting.\u2019\n\n\nC. Something that will not be the case in the future:\n\nThis one is relatively rare, but still possible:\n\nHere too there\u2019s no special form for ongoing action.\n\n\n**\n__The \u2018then\u2019 part__\n**\n\n\nA\u2019. Something that is not presently the case:\n\nB\u2019. Something that was not the case in the past:\n\nC\u2019. Something that will not be the case in the future\n\nThe if- and then-parts can combine in different ways. Some examples:\n\nOne more wrinkle:\n\n\nIn the first three examples above\u2014A with A\u2019, B with B\u2019, C with C\u2019\u2014the forms of the verb in both parts of the sentence are the same: *\nl<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">iv__u/\u2019<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">iv__efu, l<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">imv__u/\u2019<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">imv__efu, z<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\u00ecyev__up/sr<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">\u00ecyev__ew\n*. In such cases\u2014and only in such cases\u2014the verb in the *zel*-part of the sentence may optionally go into the root form, losing the subjunctive infixes. This simplification occurs very often in colloquial speech and frequently in more formal speech as well. Repeating the three sentences above in this simplified form:\n\n\n\nI think that\u2019s plenty for one post. <img src=\"Naviteri/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":-)\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />\n\n\nDon\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t assimilate these structures immediately\u2014it may take some time to get used to them. But you will.\n\n\n*Hayalovay, ma smuk.*\n\n\n", "new vocabulary": [], "tags": ["colloquial", "formal", "discussion"]}, "Looking back, looking forward": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2013/06/looking-back-looking-forward/", "content": "*Kaltx\u00ec n\u00ecmun, ma eylan,*\n\n\n\n*Tse*, EuroAvatar 2013 is well behind us. And what a great meet-up it was! John and I were so happy to be able to get to know and spend time with members of the European Avatar community and *l\u00ec\u2019fyaolo\u2019*. The language classes, the radio play, the singing, the food, the wonderful birthday party for John, the great organization (*irayo n\u00ectxan, ma Passi!*)\u2014everything was fantastic.\n\n\nAnd as icing on the cake, the Berlin meet-up was followed just over a week later by an unexpected but delightful mini-meet-up with French fans in Paris!\n\nI\u2019ve posted some pictures below, but first, here are a few vocabulary items plus a point of grammatical clarification that were prompted by the Berlin meet-up:\n\n\n**okup** (n., O.kup) \u2018milk\u2019\n\n\n\n**loi** (n., LO.i) \u2018egg\u2019\n\n\n\n**tsyeym** (n.) \u2018treasure; something rare and of great value\u2019\n\n\n\n__The \u201cdouble-dative\u201d construction__\n\n\n\nAs you know, to say \u2018I sent my brother a message,\u2019 you put the direct object of \u2018send,\u2019 i.e. the thing you sent (in this case, a message) in the objective or accusative case (the \u201ct-case\u201d), and the indirect object, i.e. the person *to whom* the message was sent,  in the dative case (the \u201cru-case\u201d). And of course you use the agentive case for \u2018I\u2019:\n\n\n\nBut what if it\u2019s \u2018I *wrote* my brother a message\u2019?\n\n\n\n\u2018Write,\u2019 as you know, is a *si*-construction, which has a different syntax: \u2018I\u2019 is in the subjective case, which is used with intransitive subjects, and the direct object in English becomes a dative in Na\u2019vi. (I like to think of it as: \u2018I do writing to a message.\u2019 That\u2019s terrible English but good Na\u2019vi.) But what about \u2018my brother\u2019? Is that in the dative case too? Yes, it is:\n\n\nWe call this a \u201cdouble-dative\u201d construction for the obvious reason.\n\n\nThe question that immediately comes up is this: given the two datives, one representing the direct object of \u2018write\u2019 and one the indirect object, will there ever be confusion as to which is which? Fortunately, this doesn\u2019t happen. One of the datives is in the class of things that can be written (messages, notes, blog posts, books, etc.) and the other in the class of things that can be written *to*\u2014basically, people. The two classes don\u2019t overlap, so there\u2019s no ambiguity.\n\n\n\nOf course, writing was only introduced on Pandora with the advent of the *Sawtute*, so you might think that this construction was introduced at that time as well. But in fact it was already in place in the language. Consider *law si*, for example, which means \u2018to make clear\u2019:\n\n\n\nAs with *pamrel si*, there\u2019s no danger of ambiguity here. The other possible interpretation, \u2018They made me clear to the meaning,\u2019 makes no sense.\n\n\nYou may also recall Jake\u2019s line from Avatar, which also has two datives:\n\n\nIn this case, the word order allows you to interpret the sentence correctly. (\u2018Everyone has something to say to me\u2019 would be *Lu frapor ayl\u00ec\u2019u oeru*.)\n\n\nAnd now for the promised pictures.\n\nBerlin welcoming committee at the train station:\n\n\n<a href=\"http://naviteri.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Welcome-party-1.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"Welcome party 1\" src=\"Naviteri/Welcome-party-1.jpg\" />\n</a>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://naviteri.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Welcome-party-3.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"Welcome party 3\" src=\"Naviteri/Welcome-party-3.jpg\" />\n</a>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://naviteri.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Welcome-party-2.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"Welcome party 2\" src=\"Naviteri/Welcome-party-2.jpg\" />\n</a>\n\n\nAt camp, we were welcomed by a genuine brass band!\n\n\n<a href=\"http://naviteri.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_5148.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"Brass band\" src=\"Naviteri/IMG_5148.jpg\" />\n</a>\n\n\nThe birthday boy at his party:\n\n\n<a href=\"http://naviteri.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Birthday.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"Birthday\" src=\"Naviteri/Birthday.jpg\" />\n</a>\n\n\nWhat a beautiful cake!\n\n\n<a href=\"http://naviteri.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Cake.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"Cake\" src=\"Naviteri/Cake.jpg\" />\n</a>\n\n\nWe had some wonderful singers and musicians in our group:\n\n\n<a href=\"http://naviteri.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Singing.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"Singing\" src=\"Naviteri/Singing.jpg\" />\n</a>\n\n\nFormal group portrait:\n\n\n<a href=\"http://naviteri.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/groupshot_sig.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"groupshot_sig\" src=\"Naviteri/groupshot_sig.jpg\" />\n</a>\n\n\nThe Paris contingent!\n\n\n<a href=\"http://naviteri.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Paris.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"Paris\" src=\"Naviteri/Paris.jpg\" />\n</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking ahead:\n\nExcitement is building for the U.S. Avatar Meet-up in the Washington, DC area (more precisely, at Shenandoah National Park in Virginia).\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.AvatarMeet.com\">www.AvatarMeet.com</a>\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll be teaching a Na\u2019vi 102 class and an informal 101 refresher as well.

(The Air and Space Museum is enthralling!)\n\n\nAnd an excellent meet-up it was. We had about two dozen attendees, including five from across the Atlantic. Jon Landau made a virtual appearance just before the showing of the extended version of Avatar, which received a very enthusiastic response, and LEI (Lightstorm Entertainment Inc.) contributed refreshments and funded the use of the room. I taught two Na\u2019vi classes\u2014an informal 101 refresher held at the campsite, with all of us sitting in a semi-circle on the grass (and with the occasional interruptions of close-by *yerik \u2019Rrtay\u00e4* that stole the show), followed the next day by a \u201chi-tech\u201d 102 class indoors, complete with PowerPoint and a virtual whiteboard. Mikko and Peter set up the technology perfectly, and Alan recorded it all for posterity. Both kinds of classes had merit, I think, so I\u2019ll keep that in mind for the future.\n\n\n\nA highlight of the meet-up was the hike on Sunday to Dark Hollow Falls, a beautiful spot deep in the forest. We had five *tute aean* along, who scampered across streams and struck poses on rocks. As you might suspect, there were many encounters between the Na\u2019vi and the startled Sawtute who had never before met them up close and personal. I can\u2019t wait to see the pictures.\n\n\n\nAll in all, it was a wonderful meet-up. *Irayo* to Mikko, Alan, Peter, DJ Makto, and everyone else who had a hand in making it a success. *Irayo* for the thoughtful and generous gifts presented to John and me. And of course, *irayo* to everyone who came. For those who couldn\u2019t make it this time, *n\u00ecs\u00eclpey alo ahay*.\n\n\n\nAnd now a bit of vocabulary, some of which was inspired by the *tsawlultxa*:\n\n\n\n**sr\u00e4** (n.) \u2018cloth: a piece of cloth woven on a loom\u2019\n\n\n\nA *sr\u00e4* is created by warp and weft weaving.\n\n\n\n**srok** (n.) \u2018bead (decorative)\u2019\n\n\n\u2018I would guess that Tsenu used a thousand (lit. 512) beads for that beautiful multi-colored bib necklace.\u2019\n\nFinally, \u2018chocolate\u2019 and \u2018pineapple\u2019 both came up for discussion. Since the Na\u2019vi only encountered these food items through contact with the Sawtute, it\u2019s natural that in talking about them they would borrow the English terms, filtered through the Na\u2019vi sound system. So:\n\n\n**tsyokl\u00ect** (n., TSYOK.l\u00ect) \u2018chocolate\u2019\n\n\n\n**payn\u00e4pll** (n., PAY.n\u00e4.pll) \u2018pineapple\u2019\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to speculate whether these terms would evoke associations among the Na\u2019vi, consciously or unconsciously, with common words in their language. For example, *tsyokl\u00ect* sounds a bit like *tsyokx* \u2018hand\u2019 + *litx* \u2018sharp (as a blade).\u2019 And *payn\u00e4pll* might bring to mind *pay* \u2018water, liquid\u2019 + *n\u00e4n* \u2018decrease\u2019 + *plltxe* \u2018speech.\u2019 Chocolate as a sharp hand?

It&#8217;s one of the four songs I translated during the filming of &#8220;Avatar&#8221; from English lyrics written by James Cameron. But I thought it would be useful for both listening and pronunciation practice. Besides, it&#8217;s always nice to have something ready at hand to trot out when people say to you, &#8220;Give me an example of what Na&#8217;vi sounds like.&#8221; For that purpose I often quote part of the Hunt Song, which has a nice &#8220;swing&#8221; to it.\n\n\n\nIt was interesting to decide what Na&#8217;vi poetry would sound like. Different languages base the structure of poetry on different elements. For example, poetry in Ancient Greek, Classical Latin, Classical Arabic, and Classic Persian is based on syllable length: in those languages, rhythmic poetical structures, called meters, consist of complicated arrangements of short and long (and sometimes extra-long) syllables. In some other languages, it&#8217;s not the length of syllables but the number of syllables per line that&#8217;s important. French poetry works that way. In still other languages**\u2014**English and German, for example (excluding so-called &#8220;free verse&#8221;)**\u2014**it&#8217;s stress that&#8217;s important: poetry depends on the arrangement of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line. Since stress is important in Na&#8217;vi**\u2014**it&#8217;s the difference between &#8216;person&#8217; and &#8216;woman,&#8217; for example!**\u2014**that&#8217;s what I based Na&#8217;vi poetry on.\n\n\n\nHere&#8217;s the text of the Hunt Song along with a word-for-word gloss. As you&#8217;ll see, the syntax is sometimes a bit convoluted, with word orders that wouldn&#8217;t be common in ordinary conversation, and there are some unusual stresses. You&#8217;ll also notice that certain unstressed syllables are elided**\u2014**that is to say, &#8220;swallowed up&#8221;**\u2014**in a way that would be unlikely in speech. But that&#8217;s what&#8217;s called &#8220;poetic license.&#8221;  <img src=\"Naviteri/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":-)\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\">\n**1**\n__\n\n\n\n**Chorus**\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\">\n**2**\n__\n\n\n\n**[Repeat chorus]**\n\n\nAs you listen to and practice reciting this poem, it&#8217;s important to get a good feel for the rhythm. Basically, the poem divides into lines of four beats each. (Exception: the last line of the chorus has only three beats.) The above division into lines, which follows the English, is misleading in this respect. So here&#8217;s a recap of the poem with the four-beat lines arranged in a clear way. The stressed syllables in each line have been capitalized and bolded. In the recordings, I&#8217;ve tried to emphasize the stressed syllables to help you get the swing of the rhythm.\n\n\nTer\u00ec**RAN **ay**O**e** **ay**NGA**ne,** **ze**RA**\u2019u**\n\n**Re**ROL **ay**O**e** **ay**NGA**ne, ha**\nFTXEY\n**\u2019**AW\n**pot** **set **FTXEY** ay**NGAL** a l(u) ay**NGA**kip**\n\n**\u2019**AW\n**pot** **a** NA\u2019**viru** YOM**t\u00ec**Y\u00ccNG**.\n\n\n<audio controls=\"controls\" preload=\"none\">\n<source src=\"Naviteri/01-Ter\u00ecran.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\" />\n</audio>\n\n\n\n**OEY**\u00e4** **swi**ZAW **n\u00ec**NGAY **ti**VA**kuk**\n\nOEY\n**\u00e4** **tuk**RUL **txe\u2019**LA**nit** **ti**VA**kuk**\n\nOE\n**ri** **t\u00ec**NGAY**\u00ecl** **txe\u2019**LA**nit** **ti**VA**kuk**\n\nOEY\n**\u00e4** **txe\u2019**LAN **livu** NGAY**.\n\n\n<audio controls=\"controls\" preload=\"none\">\n<source src=\"Naviteri/02-Chorus.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\" />\n</audio>\n\n\n\nLu nga** WIN **s\u00ec** TXUR**,** **lu nga** TXAN**tslu**\nSAM\n**Livu** WIN **s\u00ec** TXUR **oe** ZE**ne** **han(\u00ec)**\n\u2019AW\nPXAN\n**livu** TXO **n\u00ec\u2019**AW **oe** NGA**ri,**\n\nTSA\n**krr** **nga** NA\u2019**viru** YOM**t\u00ec**Y\u00ccNG**.\n\n\n<audio controls=\"controls\" preload=\"none\">\n<source src=\"Naviteri/03-Lu-nga-win.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\" />\n</audio>\n\n\n\n**Tivaron n\u00eczawnong, ma eylan!**\n\n\n\n****P.S. **\u2014**I wonder** **if there are any **ayfamtseotu** out there who might like to try setting the Hunt Song to music.\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-size: small;\"> Edit Sept. 1: Awpot &#8211;&gt; \u2019Awpot (4 times) Irayo, ma Plumps!__\n\n\n", "new vocabulary": [], "tags": ["grammar", "writing", "discussion"]}, "\u2019On s\u00ec Salewfya\u2014Shapes and Directions": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2013/09/on-si-salewfya-shapes-and-directions/", "content": "****\n*Kaltx\u00ec, ma eylan!

In particular, it\u2019s used in talking about trade\u2014trading X for Y. The verbs we typically find in **yoa** sentences are those relevant for giving (*t\u00ecng*), receiving (*tel*), getting or acquiring (*kanom*), offering (*stxenut\u00ecng*), accepting (*mll\u2019an*), etc.\n\n\n\nA few examples contributed by the LEP will make the use of *yoa* clear:\n\n\nThe next two examples are a bit more complicated.\n\nHere, one of the \u201citems\u201d participating in the exchange is in fact an action performed by someone\u2014that is, a clause:\n\nAnd this example merits careful examination:\n\n(Question: If A = agent, P = patient or object, and V = verb, what\u2019s the basic word order of this sentence\u2014APV, AVP, PAV, PVA, VAP, or VPA?)\n\n\nHere *\u2019Rrtam\u00ec* we can adapt *kanom* + *yoa* in a natural way to talk about buying things.

Note that **tsonta** is NOT derived from **tson** + **ta**!\n\n\n\n**tsonta** (conj., TSON.ta) \u2018to (with **kx\u00ecm**)\u2019\n\n\n\n(Note in the previous sentence that as long as \u201ctheir\u201d can be understood from the context, it doesn\u2019t need to be expressed in Na\u2019vi.)\n\n\nDerived forms:\n\n\n**t\u00eckx\u00ecm** (n., t\u00ec.KX\u00ccM) \u2018commanding, ordering, assigning tasks\u2019\n\n\n\n**\n\nt\u00eckx\u00ecm si\n** (vin., t\u00ec.KX\u00ccM si) \u2018be above someone in a hierarchy, be someone\u2019s superior\u2019\n\n\n\n**\n\nkx\u00ecmyu\n** (n., KX\u00ccM.yu) \u2018commander, one with authority over another\u2019\n\n\n\n(Note that in the above sentence, **lu** has been omitted, which is very frequent in conversation with interrogative words like **pesu/tupe**, **peu/\u2019upe**, etc.)\n\n\n\nAnother way to say the above sentence, of course, is **Pesu t\u00eckx\u00ecm si ngar?**\n\n\nFinally, note this useful conversational expression:\n\n\n<audio controls=\"controls\" preload=\"none\">\n<source src=\"Naviteri/10-Kximyu.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\" />\n</audio>\n\n**Kx\u00ecmyu nga.** \u2018Please! Go ahead. You first.\u2019\n\n\n\nLiterally, this says, \u201cMy commander (is) you.\u201d It\u2019s used as politeness formula to tell someone (who doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be above you) to go through a door first, take the last piece of **teylu**, etc.\n\n\nAnd speaking of et cetera:\n\n\n**saylahe** (adv., say.LA.he) \u2018et cetera\u2019\n\n\n\n**Saylahe** is a contraction of **s\u00ec aylahe** \u2018and others.\u2019 In writing, the abbreviation sl. may be used where we would use etc.\n\n\nFpomron: Mental health\n\n\nYou\u2019re already familiar with the words having to do with bodily health or well-being: **fpomtokx**, **lefpomtokx**, **kelfpomtokx**. If we substitute **ron** for **tokx** in these words (**ron** is shortened from **ronsem**, \u2018mind\u2019), we get the corresponding words for mental health:\n\n\n\n**fpomron** (n., fpom.RON) \u2018health or well-being (mental)\u2019\n\n\n\n**lefpomron** (adj., le.fpom.RON) \u2018healthy (mentally)\u2019\n\n\n\n**kelfpomron** (adj., kel.fpom.RON) \u2018unhealthy (mentally)\u2019\n\n\n\nNote that the four adjectives **lefpomtokx**, **kelfpomtokx, lefpomron**, and **kelfpomron ** are ofp\u2014only for people. If you want to say that something is unhealthful, you need to use the nfp\u2014not for people\u2014forms, which end in **\u2013nga\u2019**.\n\n\n\n**fpomtokxnga\u2019** (adj. nfp, fpom.TOKX.nga\u2019) \u2018healthful (physically)\u2019\n\n\n\n**kefpomtokxnga\u2019** (adj. nfp, ke.fpom.TOKX.nga\u2019) \u2018unhealthful (physically)\u2019\n\n\n\n**fpomronga\u2019** (adj. nfp, fpom.RO.nga\u2019) \u2018healthful (mentally)\u2019\n\n\n\n**kefpomronga\u2019** (adj. nfp, ke.fpom.RO.nga\u2019) \u2018unhealthful (mentally)\u2019\n\n\n\n(Note that in these words, **-ronnga\u2019** \u00e0 **-ronga\u2019**. Cf. **ingyenga\u2019**.)\n\n\n\nBy the way, we used to have this distinction in English: there was \u201chealthy\u201d for a person and \u201chealthful\u201d for things that promoted health. So Alice would be healthy, but the salad she was eating would be healthful. Almost no one seems to observe that distinction anymore; the word &#8216;healthful&#8217; has declined precipitously.\n\n\nA note on pronunciation: When an ejective is immediately followed by a consonant, it can be hard to pronounce. In many such cases it\u2019s simply pronounced as a \u201cregular\u201d stop, although there\u2019s no change in the writing. So in particular,\n\n\n**in pronunciation only. **For example, **fpomtokxnga\u2019 **is pronounced as if it were simply **fpomtoknga\u2019**.\n\n\n\nAlso notice what happens to the pronunciation of kx in **fpomtokx s\u00ec fpomron** in one of the above examples.\n\n\nAnd some miscellaneous vocabulary:\n\n\n**srefp\u00ecl** (vtr., sre.FP\u00ccL\u2014inf. 2, 2) \u2018assume\u2019\n\n\n\n**Srefp\u00ecl** is stronger than \u2019**en si** \u2018guess,\u2019 in that it reflects the speaker\u2019s current understanding of a situation from the available data.\n\n\n\n(That\u2019s one of the example sentences that came directly from the LEP. I love it!)\n\n\n\n**Srefp\u00ecl** may also be used intransitively with **tsn\u00ec**:\n\n\n\n**\nsrefwa\n**(conj., SRE.fwa) \u2018before\u2019\n\n\n\nThis word corresponds to **mawfwa** \u2018after.\u2019 I was surprised to discover it wasn\u2019t in the dictionary, so here it is.\n\n\n\nAnd finally, a pair of \u201ccorrelatives\u201d\u2014words that go together in pairs.\n\n\n\n**ken\u2019aw** (adv., ken.\u2019AW) \u2018not only\u2019\n\n\n\n**sl\u00e4kop** (adv., SL\u00c4.kop) \u2018but also\u2019\n\n\n\n**Ken\u2019aw** is derived from **ke** + **n\u00ec\u2019aw**; **sl\u00e4kop** is obviously **sl\u00e4** **+ kop**. They\u2019re usually used together, although **sl\u00e4kop** can appear by itself as well.\n\n\n\nIf you think these words are very like the corresponding words in English in their structure and use, you\u2019re right. Needless to say there\u2019s no connection between Na\u2019vi and English (other than a few borrowed terms), but sometimes things in unrelated languages develop in parallel ways. This is an example of that phenomenon.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s it for now. **Ayngari s\u00eclpey oe tsn\u00ec ken\u2019aw fpomtokx sl\u00e4kop fpomron yivo&#8217;.** <img src=\"Naviteri/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />** Hayalovay!**\n\n\n", "new vocabulary": ["**tson** (n.) \u2018obligation, duty, imposed requirement\u2019", "**n\u00ectson** (adv., n\u00ec.TSON) \u2018dutifully, as an obligation\u2019", "**kx\u00ecm** (vtr.) \u2018command, order, assign a task\u2019", "**tsonta** (conj., TSON.ta) \u2018to (with **kx\u00ecm**)\u2019", "**t\u00eckx\u00ecm** (n., t\u00ec.KX\u00ccM) \u2018commanding, ordering, assigning tasks\u2019", "**saylahe** (adv., say.LA.he) \u2018et cetera\u2019", "**fpomron** (n., fpom.RON) \u2018health or well-being (mental)\u2019", "**lefpomron** (adj., le.fpom.RON) \u2018healthy (mentally)\u2019", "**kelfpomron** (adj., kel.fpom.RON) \u2018unhealthy (mentally)\u2019", "**fpomtokxnga\u2019** (adj. nfp, fpom.TOKX.nga\u2019) \u2018healthful (physically)\u2019", "**kefpomtokxnga\u2019** (adj. nfp, ke.fpom.TOKX.nga\u2019) \u2018unhealthful (physically)\u2019", "**fpomronga\u2019** (adj. nfp, fpom.RO.nga\u2019) \u2018healthful (mentally)\u2019", "**kefpomronga\u2019** (adj. nfp, ke.fpom.RO.nga\u2019) \u2018unhealthful (mentally)\u2019", "**srefp\u00ecl** (vtr., sre.FP\u00ccL\u2014inf. 2, 2) \u2018assume\u2019", "**ken\u2019aw** (adv., ken.\u2019AW) \u2018not only\u2019", "**sl\u00e4kop** (adv., SL\u00c4.kop) \u2018but also\u2019"], "tags": ["vocabulary", "conversation", "discussion"]}, "Twenty before the Holidays": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2014/11/twenty-before-the-holidays/", "content": "**Kaltx\u00ec ayngaru, ma eylan.**\n\n\nI hope you\u2019re all doing well and looking forward to healthy and happy holidays.\n\nHere are some new vocabulary items I hope you\u2019ll find useful. Thanks, as always, to the stalwart LEP contributors for some of these ideas.\n\nFirst, some words for good and bad sights and sounds.\n\nNa\u2019vi distinguishes two kinds of \u2018noise\u2019:\n\n\n**v\u00e4pam** (n., V\u00c4.pam) \u2018noise: ugly or unpleasant sound, screech\u2019\n\n\n\n**hawmpam** (n., HAWM.pam) \u2018noise: sound that is excessive, unnecessary, inappropriate, unexpected, or startling\u2019\n\n\n\nAs you see, **v\u00e4pam**, from **v\u00e4\u2019** \u2018unpleasant to the senses\u2019 + **pam** \u2018sound,\u2019 is always an unpleasant sound; **hawmpam**, from **hawng** \u2018overabundance\u2019 + **pam**, is not necessarily an ugly sound but rather one that\u2019s somehow wrong\u2014a sound that in some sense shouldn\u2019t be there.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\nDerivations:\n\n\n\n**lehawmpam** (adj., le.HAWM.pam) \u2018noisy\u2019\n\n\n\n**n\u00echawmpam** (adv., n\u00ec.HAWM.pam) \u2018noisily\u2019\n\n\n\nAnd here are some other adjectives relating to good and bad sounds\u2014and sights\u2014built on the **ftx\u00eclor/ftx\u00ecv\u00e4\u2019** (\u2018good tasting/bad tasting\u2019\u2014literally, \u2018pleasant or unpleasant to the tongue\u2019) pattern we\u2019ve already seen. These words are more specific than the general adjectives **lor** and **v\u00e4\u2019**, which can be applied to any sensory experience.\n\n\n\n**miklor** (adj., mik.LOR) \u2018pleasant sounding, beautiful sounding\u2019\n\n\n\n**mikv\u00e4\u2019** (adj., mik.V\u00c4\u2019) \u2018bad-sounding\u2019\n\n\n\n**narlor** (adj., nar.LOR) \u2018beautiful visually\u2019\n\n\n\n**narv\u00e4\u2019** (adj., nar. V\u00c4\u2019) \u2018ugly, unsightly\u2019\n\n\nAnd since we\u2019ve been talking about sounds:\n\n\n**zawr** (n.) \u2018animal call\u2019\n\n\nLet me quote the LEP committee here, since they\u2019ve provided a nice explanation of this word:\n\n\n\u201c**Zawr** is used for the sound an animal makes for vocal communication. It can be used alone to mean \u201can animal cry\u201d or \u201cthe call of an animal,\u201d but it\u2019s very general . . . When translating into English, it can then be changed to mean whatever sound is normally associated [with a particular animal]: the roar of a **palulukan**, the screech of an **ikran**, the bellow of a **talioang**.\u201d\n\n\n\n**Zawr** thus takes the place of a more specific word for a particular animal\u2019s vocalization, like **nguway** for the howl of a **nantang**. It\u2019s always correct, although the specific words are more colorful.\n\n\n\n**\n\nt\u00ecnew\n** (n., t\u00ec.NEW) \u2018desire\u2019\n\n\n\n**T\u00ecnew** is parallel to **t\u00eckin** \u2018need,\u2019 in that it can refer either to the general state or concept or to a specific instance.\n\n\n\n**\n\nnopx\n** (vtr.) \u2018put away, store\u2019\n\n\n\n**\n\ntiam\n** (vtr., TI.am\u2014inf. 1, 2) \u2018count\u2019\n\n\n\nDerived from **tiam** we have a word for infinite or uncountable:\n\n\n\n**ketsuktiam** (adj., ke.tsuk.TI.am) \u2018uncountable, infinite\u2019\n\n\n\nNote that this word doesn\u2019t necessarily mean something is **literally** uncountable or infinite, but only that the number is exceedingly large.\n\n\n\nA related word is:\n\n\n\n**txewluke** (adj., TXEW.lu.ke) \u2018endless, boundless, without limit\u2019\n\n\n\nThe basic difference between **ketsuktiam** and **txewluke** is that the former is for countables while the latter is for noncountables:\n\n\n\n** \u2019umtsa** (n., \u2019UM.tsa) \u2018medicine\u2019\n\n\n\n**\n\nlang\n** (vtr.) \u2018investigate, explore\u2019\n\n\n\nThere is overlap in meaning between **lang** and **steftxaw** \u2018examine, check.\u2019 **Lang** has a sense of exploring something previously unknown, without preconceived notions of what you\u2019re going to find; **steftxaw** can imply a detailed examination of the components of something, perhaps against a checklist. But the two are often interchangeable.\n\n\n\nDerivations:\n\n\n\n**t\u00eclang** (n., t\u00ec.LANG) \u2018exploration (general sense)\u2019\n\n\n\n**s\u00e4lang** (n., s\u00e4.LANG) \u2018an exploration or investigation\u2019\n\n\n\nFinally, here are a couple of idiomatic expressions you may find useful.\n\n\nFirst, a couple of new words:\n\n\n**kxum** (adj.) \u2018viscous, gelatinous, thick\u2019\n\n\n\n**kxumpay** (n., KXUM.pay) \u2018viscous liquid, gel\u2019\n\n\n\n**Kxumpay** is the word used for the aloe-like gel derived from the leaves of the **paywll** \u2018dapophet\u2019 plant that\u2019s used as an **\u2019umtsa**.\n\n\n\nIdiom: (**Na) kenten m\u00ec kumpay**\n\n\n\nLiterally, this is \u2018(like) a fan lizard in gel.\u2019 (Note that we would expect a linking **a** in this phrase: **na kenten a m\u00ec kumpay**. In proverbial expressions, however, the **a** is often omitted.)\n\n\n\nThe sense is one of being in an environment where you\u2019re prevented from acting naturally or doing what you want to do. The **kenten** wants to spread his beautiful fan and fly away, but being encased in gel, he is unable to.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nIdiom: (**Na) loreyu \u2019awnampi**\n\n\n\nLiterally, \u2018(like) a touched helicoradian\u2019 (Again, the expected **a** has been omitted in a proverbial expression.)\n\n\n\nAs you recall from the film, **loreyu** are the beautiful spiral-shaped plants that immediately curl up and vanish when touched. The analogy is used to indicate extreme shyness.\n\n\n\nUntil next time. **Hayalovay, ma smuk!**\n\n\n", "new vocabulary": ["**v\u00e4pam** (n., V\u00c4.pam) \u2018noise: ugly or unpleasant sound, screech\u2019", "**hawmpam** (n., HAWM.pam) \u2018noise: sound that is excessive, unnecessary, inappropriate, unexpected, or startling\u2019", "**lehawmpam** (adj., le.HAWM.pam) \u2018noisy\u2019", "**n\u00echawmpam** (adv., n\u00ec.HAWM.pam) \u2018noisily\u2019", "**miklor** (adj., mik.LOR) \u2018pleasant sounding, beautiful sounding\u2019", "**mikv\u00e4\u2019** (adj., mik.V\u00c4\u2019) \u2018bad-sounding\u2019", "**narlor** (adj., nar.LOR) \u2018beautiful visually\u2019", "**narv\u00e4\u2019** (adj., nar.

If it\u2019s clear from the context, **t\u00ecftiatu kifkey\u00e4 **may be shortened to simply **t\u00ecftiatu; **by itself, the word has the force of \u2018researcher.\u2019\n\n\n\nNote two things here. First, the stress in **t\u00ecftiatu** is on the **a**, since that\u2019s where it is in the root verb **ftia** \u2018study.\u2019 Second, to name the person doing the studying in this case, Na\u2019vi uses **\u2013tu** rather than the agentive suffix **\u2013yu**. For a discussion of **\u2013tu** vs. **\u2013yu**, see the post \u201cA note on the word **yora\u2019tu,**\u201d December 31, 2011.\n\n\n\n**heyr** (n.) \u2018chest\u2019\n\n\nThis term, indicating the area between the stomach and throat, applies to both people and animals.\n\n\n**tseri** (vtr., TSE.ri\u2014inf. 1,2) \u2018note, notice\u2019\n\n\n\nFor the negative, we need to distinguish intentional from unintentional non-notice. When you overlook or fail to notice something unintentionally or carelessly, that\u2019s simply the negative of **tseri**:\n\n\nDerivation:\n\n\n**t\u00ectseri** (n., t\u00ec.TSE.ri) \u2018awareness, notice\u2019\n\n\n\n**t\u00ecktseri** (n., t\u00eck.TSE.ri) \u2018unawareness, lack of notice\u2019\n\n\n\nAs you might suspect, **t\u00ecktseri** is derived from **t\u00ec **+ **ke** **+ tseri**.\n\n\nFor intentional overlooking, we have a separate verb:\n\n\n**y\u00e4kx** (vtr.) \u2018not notice; ignore, snub\u2019\n\n\nDerivation:\n\n\n**t\u00ecy\u00e4kx** (n., t\u00ec.Y\u00c4KX) \u2018lack of notice; snubbing\u2019\n\n\n\n**srunga\u2019** (adj., SRU.nga\u2019) \u2018helpful\u2019 (nfp)\n\n\n\n**Tseri**: **Srunga\u2019** comes from **srung** + **nga\u2019**. Here the two **ng**\u2019s have coalesced into one. Compare **sngum** + **nga\u2019** which becomes **sngunga\u2019** \u2018worrisome, troubling.\u2019\n\n\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s a proverb that capitalizes on the similarity in sound of **srunga\u2019** and **sngunga\u2019**:\n\n\n\nParallel to **kxapnga\u2019**, **srunga\u2019** is not for people. A helpful person is **tute a srung si** or **srung si a tute**.\n\n\n\n**s\u00e4y\u00e4kx** (n., s\u00e4.Y\u00c4KX) \u2018snub\u2019\n\n\n\n**ngip** (n.) \u2018space, open or borderless area\u2019\n\n\n\nNote the difference between **mo** and **ngip**, both of which have to do with spaces. **Mo** refers to an enclosed open area or hollow, while **ngip** refers to an unenclosed, borderless area.\n\n\n\n**txepram** (n., txep.RAM) \u2018volcano\u2019\n\n\n\n**txekxumpay** (n., txe.KXUM.pay) \u2018magma, lava\u2019\n\n\n\n**Txep** \u2018fire\u2019 is a component of both these words. In **txekxumpay**, the **p** of **txep** has dropped.\n\n\n\n**wrrza\u2019u** (vin., wrr.ZA.\u2019u) \u2018come out, emerge)\n\n\n\n**tskxevi** (n., TSKXE.vi) \u2018pebble\u2019\n\n\n\n**n\u00eckx** (n.) \u2018gravel\u2019\n\n\n\n**Tskxevi** refers to small stones polished smooth by natural forces. **N\u00eckx** is rock that has been crushed either naturally or artificially.\n\n\n\n**t\u00ecralpeng** (n., t\u00ec.ral.PENG) \u2018translation, interpretation\u2019\n\n\n\n**unil si** (vin., U.nil si) \u2018dream\u2019\n\n\n\n**uniltsa** (vtr., U.nil.tsa\u2014inf. 3, 3) \u2018dream of, dream about, dream (that)\u2019\n\n\n\nBoth **unil si** and **\n__uniltsa__\n** (a contraction of **unil** + **tse\u2019a**, \u201cdream-see\u201d) mean \u2018dream,\u2019 but they\u2019re used differently. **Unil si** just indicates the action of dreaming:\n\n\n\nTo say you were dreaming of or about something, use **uniltsa**:\n\n\n\n**mauti** (n., MA.u.ti) \u2018fruit\u2019\n\n\n\n**utu** (n., U.tu) \u2018forest canopy\u2019\n\n\n\n**utumauti** (n., U.tu.ma.u.ti) \u2018banana fruit\u2019\n\n\nThe delicacy known in English as \u2018banana fruit\u2019 is actually \u2018canopy fruit\u2019 in Na\u2019vi, since it grows high in the forest canopy and is relatively inaccessible.\n\n\n**slayk** (vtr.) \u2018brush, comb\u2019\n\n\n\nFinally, here are links to videos of the Na\u2019vi 103 class I taught at the Avatar Meet-up last year in Los Angeles. As always, our intrepid videographer, Alan Taylor, has done a fantastic job in putting it all together in a totally professional and very appealing format. **Irayo n\u00ectxan ngar, ma \u00c4l\u00ecn!

As always, a big thank-you to the LEP contributors for their excellent suggestions.\n\n\n**t\u00eckelu** (n., t\u00ec.KE.lu) \u2018lack\u2019\n\n\nThe derivation, I think, is obvious.\n\nThe particular lack you\u2019re talking about is indicated by a noun in the genitive, just as we say in English, \u201ca lack of ____.\u201d\n\n\nCertain important lacks, however, have become lexicalized. For these, \u201clack\u201d is indicated by the suffix **\u2013kel**. It\u2019s not productive, which is to say you\u2019re not free to construct your own **\u2013kel** words; you just have to learn them. Two examples are:\n\n\n\n**tompakel **(n., TOM.pa.kel) \u2018drought\u2019\n\n\n\n**syuvekel **(n., SYU.ve.kel) \u2018famine\u2019\n\n\n\n**zawprrte\u2019** (vin., zaw.PRR.te\u2019\u2014inf. 1,1) \u2018be enjoyable\u2019\n\n\n\nThis word derives from **za\u2019u **+ **n\u00ecprrte\u2019**, that is, \u2018come pleasurably.\u2019\n\n\n\nAs with the related word **sunu**, the syntax here is not \u201cI enjoy X\u201d but rather \u201cX is enjoyable to me.\u201d Because of the underlying **za\u2019u**, however, the experiencer is not indicated by the dative but rather by **ne**, which we use with verbs of motion.\n\n\n\n(Note that **oene** is pronounced in two syllables [\u02c8w\u025b.n\u025b].

But note that colloquially, **yo** can be used in place of **fyanyo**.\n\nSome other words compounded with **fyan** or **yo**:\n\n**yomyo** (n., YOM.yo) \u2018plate (for food)\u2019\n\n**yomyo ler\u00eck** (n., YOM.yo le.R\u00ccK) \u2018leaf plate\u2019\n\n(Colloquially, **yomyo ler\u00eck** is often reduced to **r\u00eck**.)\n\n**fyany\u00ec** (n., FYAN.y\u00ec) \u2018shelf\u2019\n\n**Fyan** also compounds with **kur** \u2018hang\u2019 to yield these cultural terms:\n\n**kurfyan** (n., KUR.fyan) \u2018hamper or suspended rack\u2019\n\n**snokfyan **(n., SNOK.fyan) \u2018personal belongings rack\u2019\n\n**kurfyavi **(n., KUR.fya.vi) \u2018hook (for hanging or suspending an item)\n\nThese last two terms developed as follows:\n\n**sno + kurfyan &gt; snokurfyan &gt; snokfyan**\n\n**kurfyan + vi &gt; kurfyanvi &gt; kurfyavi**\n\n**seyto** (vtr., sey.TO) \u2018butcher (in the sense of separating or processing the carcass of a dead animal)\n\n**Seyto** is not to be confused with \u2018butcher\u2019 in the sense of killing an animal. There is some overlap with **px\u00ecmun\u2019i **\u2018divide, cut into parts,\u2019 but that word is more general and can be used for cutting up **anything**; **seyto** refers specifically to cutting up an animal. Also note the stress on the final syllable.\n\n**s\u00e4seyto** (n., s\u00e4.sey.TO) \u2018butchering tool\u2019\n\n**yaney** (n., ya.NEY) \u2018canoe\u2019\n\n**spulyaney** (n., spul.ya.NEY) \u2018canoe paddle\u2019\n\nThis word obviously derives from **spule** \u2018propel\u2019 + **yaney**.\n\n**lal **(adj.) \u2018old (opposite of **mip**, nfp)\u2019\n\n**txanlal **(adj., TXAN.lal) \u2018ancient, very old\u2019\n\nA word about **lal** vs. **spuwin**: Both mean \u2018old\u2019 and are generally not for people (i.e., neither one can be used for \u2018elderly\u2019\u2014that word is **koak**). So there is some overlap, but there are also some differences. **Spuwin** has the connotation of \u2018old\u2019 in the sense of \u2018former\u2019 as opposed to \u2018current,\u2019 where an older entity has been replaced by another one. In a blog post from 2011, I gave the example, **Tsatsko lu spuwin ulte ke lu mi txur**, which was translated as \u2018That bow is old and no longer strong.\u2019 The implication was that the bow had been replaced by a new one: it was the owner\u2019s former bow rather than his current one. By the same token, if we were to translate into Na\u2019vi the last line of the Who\u2019s \u201cWon\u2019t Get Fooled Again,\u201d (does anyone younger than I still listen to the Who? J )\u2014namely, \u201cMeet the new boss, same as the old boss\u201d\u2014\u201cold\u201d in this case would definitely be **spuwin**.\n\nOn the other hand, **lal **indicates something that is not new and has been around for a long time, whether or not it\u2019s been replaced. For tangible objects, it often has the implication of \u2018worn out,\u2019 \u2018broken,\u2019 \u2018tattered,\u2019 \u2018no longer usable,\u2019 etc. (Calling a person **lal** would be very insulting.) But for non-tangibles, it simply indicates long existence, as in **lala s\u00e4fp\u00ecl**, \u2018old idea.\u2019\n\n**tsankum** (n., TSAN(G).kum) \u2018advantage, benefit, upside, gain\u2019\n\nIn normal speech, **tsankum** tends to be pronounced **tsangkum**, but it\u2019s not spelled that way.\n\n**fekum** (n., FE.kum) \u2018disadvantage, drawback, downside\u2019\n\nDerivations:\n\n**tsankumnga\u2019** (adj., TSAN(G).kum.nga\u2019) \u2018advantageous\u2019\n\n**fekumnga\u2019** (adj., FE.kum.nga\u2019) \u2018disadvantageous\u2019\n\n**t\u00ecmungwrr** (n., t\u00ec.mung.WRR) \u2018exception\u2019\n\n**t\u00ecmungwrr si** (vin.) \u2018make an exception\u2019\n\n**tarpongu** (n., TAR.po.ngu) \u2018hunting party\u2019\n\n**nawfwe** (adj., naw.FWE) \u2018fluent, (for speech)\u2019\n\nThis useful word requires some explanation.\n\nYou\u2019re familiar with the expression **n\u00ecwin na hufwe** \u2018as fast as the wind,\u2019 which can be used in any situation to express rapidity. The shortened version **na hufwe** has become specialized as an adverbial expression for the fluent (not just rapid) use of language.\n\n**Na hufwe** can contract further to **nawfwe**, which is a full-fledged adjective:\n\nFinally, a question has arisen regarding time expressions like **tsakrr**. As you know, **tsakrr** is listed in the dictionary as an adverb meaning \u2018then, at that time.\u2019 The question is: Since **krr** is a noun, can **tsakrr** also be a noun meaning \u2018that time,\u2019 as in **Muntrram oe kol\u00e4teng hu Ralu ulte sunu oer tsakrr**, \u2018I spent last weekend with Ralu and had a good time (literally, that time was pleasant to me)\u2019? The answer is: absolutely! Many time expressions double as adverbs and also as nouns or noun phrases. You can tell from the context which usage is relevant.

I\u2019ve had a lot of distractions recently, some good, some bad. But things are settling down, and I hope to post some useful new vocabulary before the year is out. This brief post is a start.\n\nThanks, as always, to the LEP contributors for their creativity. Some of the words below derive from their suggestions.\n\n**zum** (n.) \u2018object, thing (physical or tangible)\u2019\n\nWe already have the familiar word **\u2019u**, of course, which means \u2018thing\u2019 in a number of different senses: a physical object, a fact, or an abstraction. So **\u2019u** can refer to a rock, or to bravery, or to the fact that Jake loves Neytiri. In contrast, **zum** is exclusively a physical or tangible object\u2014something you can see or feel.\n\n**h\u00ecpey** (vin., H\u00cc.pey\u2014inf. 2,2) \u2018hesitate, hold back for a short time\u2019\n\nThis verb derives from **h\u00ec\u2019i** \u2018small\u2019 + **pey** \u2018wait.\u2019 It differs from **fpak** in that **fpak** refers to suspending an action that\u2019s already in progress, while **h\u00ecpey** is deferring the start of an action.\n\nNote the syntax for \u2018hesitate to do something.\u2019 Also note that as in English, **h\u00ecpey** can imply a reluctance to begin or accomplish an action, for whatever reason.\n\nDerivations:\n\n**t\u00ech\u00ecpey** (n., t\u00ec.H\u00cc.pey) \u2018hesitation\u2019\n\n**leh\u00ecpey** (adj., le.H\u00cc.pey) \u2018hesitant, in a state of hesitation\u2019\n\n**n\u00ec****h\u00ecpey** (adv., n\u00ec.H\u00cc.pey) \u2018hesitantly\u2019\n\n**sn\u00e4m **(vin.) \u2018rot, decay, degrade over time\u2019\n\n**Sn\u00e4m** can refer both to the physical decaying of an object\u2014say, a piece of meat\u2014and also to the degrading of something abstract, like a skill.\n\n**kllrikx** (n., kll.RIKX) \u2018earthquake\u2019\n\nA couple of derivations of **latem** \u2018change\u2019:\n\n**s\u00e4latem** (n., s\u00e4.LA.tem) \u2018change (instance of), edit, modification\u2019\n\n**t\u00eclatem** (n., t\u00ec.LA.tem) \u2018change (abstract concept)\u2019\n\n**txatx** (n.) \u2018bubble\u2019\n\nFinally, I never provided the text and translation for the little listening exercise in the last post.

I hope you\u2019re all well.\n\nI wanted to tell you about two new members of John\u2019s and my family. They\u2019re two little cats named Palu and Lukan. They\u2019re brother and sister. I think you can understand what source those two names come from. It\u2019s clear, isn\u2019t it?\n\nLukan, the little brother, and Palu, the little sister, are still babies, and I\u2019m happy to say they\u2019re very beautiful and cute. But unfortunately they\u2019re also shy, almost like a touched helicoradian. They arrived at our house last night, and needless to say the new place and likewise the two new men are very strange to them. For most of the time today they were hiding. We hope they\u2019ll soon become brave enough to come out and play with us. Feeling calm and happy in a new environment takes time, so we have to be patient.\n\nUntil next time, brothers and sisters.\n\n**M\u00ecftxele**, I\u2019m pleased to say that Palu is now much less shy than she used to be, and Lukan is bold and fearless! They\u2019re both doing beautifully and are very happy to accept all the love we\u2019re bestowing on them. Here they are. (Lukan, the male, is the one with white between his eyes; Palu, the female, has black in the same place.)\n\n<a href=\"http://naviteri.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Thanksgiving-2015-portrait-a.jpg\"><img src=\"Naviteri/Thanksgiving-2015-portrait-a.jpg\" alt=\"Thanksgiving 2015 portrait--a\" style=\"max-width: 584px;\"></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://naviteri.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1701.jpg\"><img src=\"Naviteri/IMG_1701.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1701\" style=\"max-width: 584px;\"></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://naviteri.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1733.jpg\"><img src=\"Naviteri/IMG_1733.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1733\" style=\"max-width: 584px;\"></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://naviteri.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_1789.jpg\"><img src=\"Naviteri/IMG_1789.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1789\" style=\"max-width: 584px;\"></a>\n\nMore soon! **Hayalovay!**\n\n", "new vocabulary": ["**zum** (n.) \u2018object, thing (physical or tangible)\u2019", "**h\u00ecpey** (vin., H\u00cc.pey\u2014inf. 2,2) \u2018hesitate, hold back for a short time\u2019", "**t\u00ech\u00ecpey** (n., t\u00ec.H\u00cc.pey) \u2018hesitation\u2019", "**leh\u00ecpey** (adj., le.H\u00cc.pey) \u2018hesitant, in a state of hesitation\u2019", "**n\u00ec****h\u00ecpey** (adv., n\u00ec.H\u00cc.pey) \u2018hesitantly\u2019", "**kllrikx** (n., kll.RIKX) \u2018earthquake\u2019", "**s\u00e4latem** (n., s\u00e4.LA.tem) \u2018change (instance of), edit, modification\u2019", "**t\u00eclatem** (n., t\u00ec.LA.tem) \u2018change (abstract concept)\u2019", "**txatx** (n.) \u2018bubble\u2019"], "tags": ["vocabulary", "grammar"]}, "Mrrvola L\u00ec\u2019fyavi Amip\u2014Forty New Expressions": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2016/06/mrrvola-lifyavi-amip-forty-new-expressions/", "content": "**Kaltx\u00ec n\u00ecmun, ma eylan!** And hello again. **Tse** . . . it\u2019s been a while. <img src=\"Naviteri/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\"\"> I hope you\u2019ve all been healthy and happy during my temporary absence from the blog.

John and I returned from Pittsburgh a few days ago with very happy memories. Facilitating the move to a new city in such a short time was a daunting task, but the organizers really rose to the occasion. **Soleia, ma smuk!** (See below.) The guidebook to Pittsburgh and the Meet-up was, as usual, beautifully put together and extremely useful. The hotel was great, literally right next door to the arena where the Cirque du Soleil performance was held. I thought my Na\u2019vi class\u2014this time based on the Na\u2019vi dialog in the show we were all going to see that night, TORUK: The First Flight\u2014went pretty well; it was a special honor to welcome nine or ten cast members from the show who opted to sit in on the class! Their enthusiasm was infectious. And after the show, we were all treated to a Q&amp;A session with cast members followed by a backstage tour to see how some of the Cirque magic was created. All in all, a very successful meet-up.\n\nHere\u2019s a little interview I did for the Cirque du Soleil Facebook page, from my seat in the arena, five minutes before the show began. (The video is currently first in the \u201cAll Videos\u201d section.)\n\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/torukthefirstflight/videos\">https://www.facebook.com/torukthefirstflight/videos</a>\n\nLooking forward to next year, I\u2019m very excited about our meet-up in Orlando, Florida, during which we\u2019ll visit the new Disney theme park, Pandora: The World of AVATAR, due to open next year. I\u2019ve been working with the Disney folks on the Na\u2019vi language elements of the park, of which there will be quite a few! <img src=\"Naviteri/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\"\"> In particular, you\u2019ll hear Na\u2019vi spoken while you\u2019re on the \u201ce-ticket\u201d ride. It\u2019s being developed here in Glendale, California, and a few weeks ago I had the privilege of riding the prototype! **Wou!** I can\u2019t say much about it right now except that it\u2019s VERY exciting, and I know you\u2019re going to love it! **Z\u00ecs\u00ectayri srefereiey n\u00ecprrte\u2019!**\n\nOK, on to the new vocabulary. **N\u00ecfrakrr**, I want to thank all the members of the **l\u00ec\u2019fyaolo\u2019** who contributed ideas and suggestions. **Irayo n\u00ectxan ayngaru n\u00ecwotx, ma smuk**. Some of the words and expressions below are direct consequences of their contributions. You\u2019ll find the new items in more-or-less random order. Voice recordings of the examples will be coming soon. [UPDATE 7/07: We now have recordings for all the examples, beautifully read by our own Neytiri. **Irayo n\u00ectxan, ma tsmuk!**]\n\n**ler** (adj.) \u2018steady, smooth (for motion)\u2019\n\n**n\u00ecler** (adv., n\u00ec.LER) \u2018steadily\u2019\n\n**Ler** refers to smooth, steady motion as opposed to motion that\u2019s jerky or chaotic.\n\nYou may remember that we already have a word meaning steadily, **n\u00eck\u2019\u00e4r\u00ecp** as in **fyep n\u00eck\u2019\u00e4r\u00ecp** \u2018hold steadily,\u2019 but that\u2019s different. **N\u00eck\u2019\u00e4r\u00ecp** refers to stillness\u2014keeping something from moving. **N\u00ecler** refers to smooth movement. **N\u00ecler** may also be extended metaphorically beyond the realm of physical movement to a more general idea of smooth, unbroken action, as is the case in English: **t\u00eckangkem si n\u00ecler** \u2018to work steadily (without stopping)\u2019.\n\n**lo\u2019a **(n., LO.\u2019a) \u2018totem\u2019\n\nTotems are large structures built by the Na\u2019vi for various symbolic and ritual purposes.\n\n**Naranawm** (n., nar.a.NAWM) \u2018Polyphemus\u2019\n\nFrom **Nari anawm**, \u2018Great eye.\u2019 (And if anyone is wondering, **srane**, this term has been officially approved at the highest level. <img src=\"Naviteri/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\"\"> )\n\n**\u2019ewrang** (n., \u2019EW.rang) \u2018loom\u2019\n\n**sa\u2019ewrang** (n., sa.\u2019EW.rang) \u2018mother loom, giant loom. \u2019From **sa\u2019nok** + **\u2019ewrang**.\n\n**tiretu** (n., ti.RE.tu) \u2018shaman\u2019 From **tirea** + **tute** \u2018spirit person\u2019\n\nA **tiretu** can be male or female. Every **tsah\u00eck** is a **tiretu**, but not vice versa.\n\n**pasuk** (n., PA.suk) \u2018berry\u2019\n\nA **pasuk** is a kind of **mauti** \u2018fruit.\u2019\n\n**vozampasukut** (n., VO.zam.pa.suk.ut) \u2018grinch tree; thousand berry tree\u2019\n\nFrom **vozam** \u2018512, equivalent in use to 1,000\u2019 + **pasuk** + **ut(ral)**\n\nOne of the prominent features of the grinch tree is its edible fruit, which looks rather like a raspberry\u2014that is, made up of many little round components, almost like tiny little berries themselves. Hence the \u201cthousand-berry tree.\u201d\n\n**paskalin** (n., pa.ska.LIN) \u2018sweet berry (term of endearment)\u2019\n\nFrom **pasuk akalin** \u2018sweet berry\u2019: pasuk akalin &gt; paskakalin &gt; paskalin\n\n**fng\u00e4\u2019tseng** (n., FNG\u00c4\u2019.tseng) \u2018restroom (on earth)\u2019\n\n**mo a fng\u00e4\u2019** (n., MO a FNG\u00c4\u2019) \u2018restroom (on earth)\u2019\n\nBoth of these terms mean \u2018restroom\u2019 and can be used interchangeably on Earth. **Fng\u00e4\u2019tseng** is more general, not necessarily implying an enclosed area, so it\u2019s also used among the Na\u2019vi for any \u201cplace of elimination.\u201d In contrast, **mo a fng\u00e4\u2019** is always an enclosed private structure or room.\n\n**sa** (vin.) \u2018rise to a challenge\u2019\n\nThis simple verb yields some important related expressions:\n\n\n**Siva ko! **(si.VA ko)\n\u2018Rise to the challenge! Courage! You can do it!\u2019\n\n\n**Siva ko** indicates encouragement before or while attempting a challenge.\n\n\n**Soleia! **(so.le.i.A, or usually simply so.ley.A\u2014just make sure the stress is on the final syllable!)**\n\n**\u2018Congratulations! Nice going! You met the challenge! You did it!\u2019\n\n\n**Soleia** is used for congratulating someone after successfully meeting a challenge.\n\n\n**Sasya!** (sa.SYA)\n\u2018I\u2019ll rise to the challenge! I can do it!\u2019\n\n\n**Sasya** is used for self-encouragement before attempting a challenge. Recall that the &lt;asy&gt; version of the future infix indicates **intention** as opposed to a mere **prediction** about the future.\n\nYou can also use **sasya** as a friendly and somewhat humorous response to a request:\n\nAn idiomatic expression:\n\n**Tsun pehem?**\n\nThis is short for **Tsun fko pehem sivi?** \u2018What can one do?\u2019 It\u2019s used in a somewhat fatalistic way, when you throw up your hands in an unpleasant situation or when something doesn\u2019t turn out well, and you say, \u201cWhat are you gonna do? That\u2019s life.\u201d\n\n**tanleng **(n.,TAN.leng) \u2018bark (of a tree)\u2019\n\nFrom **tangek** \u2018trunk\u2019 + **ta\u2019leng** \u2018skin\u2019:\n\ntangekta\u2019leng &gt; tangta\u2019leng &gt; tanta\u2019leng &gt; tanleng\n\n**syokup** (n., syo.KUP) \u2018weight (physical)\u2019\n\nNote the the stress is on the second syllable.\n\n**syo** \u2018light\u2019 + **ku\u2019up** \u2018heavy\u2019 &gt; syoku\u2019up &gt; syokup\n\n**kewan **(n., KE.wan) \u2018age\u2019\n\nFrom **koak** \u2018old\u2019+ **\u2019ewan** \u2018young\u2019 &gt; ko\u2019ewan &gt; kewan\n\nYou can use **kewan** to inquire about someone\u2019s age:\n\nBut the form with **kewan** is a bit formal and stiff; the one with **solew** is more common and colloquial. Recall that **solew** is colloquial for **solalew**.\n\n**t\u00ecnvi** (n., T\u00ccN.vi) \u2018task, errand, step (in an instruction)\u2019\n\n**t\u00ecnvi si** \u2018perform a task, run an errand\u2019\n\n**txanwetseng** (n., txan.WE.tseng) \u2018personally significant or beloved place, **heimat**\u2019\n\nFrom **txanwawea tseng**. txanwawea tseng &gt; txanwea tseng &gt; txanwetseng\n\n**Txanwetseng** is close in spirit to the German word **heimat**.

It\u2019s titled \u201c6 Things You Never Knew About Inventing Languages For **Game Of Thrones **And **Avatar.\u201d **It should be appearing shortly. When it does, I\u2019ll let you know.\n\nAlso, let me take this opportunity to thank everyone who commented so positively on the last post. **Seiyi irayo, ma smuk. Ayl\u00ec\u2019u ayngey\u00e4 oeru teya si.** And let me respond to the questions and comments.\n\nTanri asked about the pronunciation of **soleia**. The careful, \u201ccorrect\u201d pronunciation, as you know, has four syllables: so.le.i.A. But in ordinary conversation, people will almost certainly reduce it to three. Would it then be so.ley.A or so.le.YA? In terms of pronunciation, I don\u2019t think it matters: there\u2019s very little difference between the two, at least to my ears.&nbsp; <img src=\"Naviteri/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\"\"> By the way, something similar happens with **kameie** in **Oel ngati kameie**. The last word is \u201ccorrectly\u201d four syllables, but almost always pronounced in three.\n\nPlumps asked what happens to a verb like **ue\u2019** if we try to add the honorific, second-position infix &lt;uy&gt;. You can see the problem: we get **uuye\u2019**, which is not allowable, since in Na\u2019vi we don\u2019t have two identical vowels in sequence. A similar problem arises, much more familiarly, when we add the positive-attitude infix &lt;ei&gt; to **si**: we should get **seii**. Well, you all know what happens in the latter case: **seii** becomes **seiyi**, where a y intervenes between the two i\u2019s. If we tried to do the same thing with **uuye\u2019**, we\u2019d get **uwuye\u2019**, where w is the natural sound to interpose between the two u\u2019s. But another possibility is simply to have the two u\u2019s coalesce into one: **uuye\u2019 **&gt; **uye\u2019**. For some reason, this feels like the more natural solution; **uwuye\u2019** just looks odd to me. I\u2019d be interested in how other people feel about this.\n\nAnd now a question for Plumps: Could you please come up with a context in which you would add the honorific infix to&nbsp;**ue\u2019?&nbsp;**I\u2019d be very interested in that story!&nbsp; <img src=\"Naviteri/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\"\">\n\nBlue Elf and Vawmataw discussed how the word Skype should appear in Na\u2019vi. When it comes to foreign terms adapted into Na\u2019vi phonology, there\u2019s often room for variation. The question we need to ask ourselves is how a native Pandoran, hearing (rather than seeing) the English (or French or German or whatever) word, would pronounce it. In the case of Skype, if Neytiri or Eytukan heard the English word \u201cSkype,\u201d there\u2019s no reason they would give it two syllables, since the English word has one syllable and a Na\u2019vi word can end with a p-sound perfectly well. So they would probably just say Skayp. Might they say Skxayp? I suppose so. To be honest, the reason I chose that form is that I saw it used that way in the **l\u00ec\u2019fyaolo\u2019** and I said to myself, \u201cWell, why not?\u201d I\u2019d be happy to have two alternate forms that can be used interchangeably: **Skayp** and **Skxayp**.\n\nFinally, Vawmataw commented that the word **paskalin** \u2018sweet berry, sweetheart\u2019 sounds just like the French word Pascaline. **Irayo, ma \u2019eylan!** I was completely unaware of that. I\u2019ve since learned from Wikipedia that a Pascaline is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_calculator\">mechanical calculator invented by Pascal in the 17<sup>th</sup> century.</a> Imagine that!\n\nThis is a nice example of what has been called a \u201cbilingualism\u201d\u2014a sequence of sounds that exists meaningfully in two languages, where the meanings are generally very different. Let me give you my two favorite examples.\n\nThe first comes from the great pianist Artur Schnabel, as related by Abram Chasins in his 1957 book **Speaking of Pianists**: \u201cI once mentioned a pianist who was about to give an all-Mozart concert. \u2018Oh,\u2019 said Schnabel, \u2018when he plays it, it isn\u2019t Mozart. It\u2019s Nozart.\u2019 Particularly ingenious, I think is the bilingualism: the English \u2018notes-art\u2019 implying the pianist\u2019s inexpressivity, and the German \u2018**no-zart**,\u2019 (**zart** meaning tender or delicate).\u201d **S\u00eclronsem n\u00ecngay, kefyak?**\n\nThe second takes a particular phrase and tries to \u201chear\u201d it in both French and Yiddish. The phrase in French would be **gai avec un fils**, which I suppose means \u201chappy with a son,\u201d although I don\u2019t know if this is really idiomatic. In any event, if you alter the pronunciation slightly and put it into Yiddish, you get \u201cGo away without feet.\u201d\n\n**Hayalovay!**\n\n", "new vocabulary": [], "tags": ["writing", "conversation", "discussion"]}, "Tengkrr per\u00e4hem z\u00ecs\u00ect amip . . .

Not using honorific language in a ceremony where such language is called for would be considered **r\u00e4ptum**, as would not deferring to rank and authority, taking too much food during a social meal, using vulgar language, etc.\n\nNote this idiom, an admonition to children: **R\u00e4\u2019\u00e4 r\u00e4ptum! **\u2018Don\u2019t be impolite!\u2019\n\n**txanlokxe** (n., txan.lo.KXE) \u2018clan or tribal domain; country\u2019\n\nThis word is derived from **txan** (great) + **olo\u2019** (tribe, clan) + **atxkxe** (land).

Its object is the thing that\u2019s being allowed:\n\nWith sentences like \u201cHe allowed me to go,\u201d however, two different structures are possible, depending on how you analyze the object of **tung**.\n\nOn the one hand, the object of **tung**\u2014that is, the thing being allowed\u2014is simply the going itself. In our example, \u201cme\u201d represents the receiver of the permit, so to speak, and goes into the dative case. So we have:\n\nJust plain **k\u00e4 **would be OK in such sentences as well:\n\nBy the way, in colloquial speech **futa** can be pronounced simply **fta**, with the **u** dropping, although it\u2019s not usually written that way. (We also have, as you know, the word **fta** meaning \u2018knot,\u2019 but I can\u2019t think of a situation where there would be the possibility of confusion.) So A2 can be even shorter, just&nbsp;four syllables: **Tung oer f(u)ta k\u00e4!**\n\nOn the other hand, we can think of the object of **tung** as MY going, not just the going itself. In this case there is no receiver in the dative case, and we have:\n\nSo A says that what he allowed is going, and he allowed it to me; B says that what he allowed is my going. It\u2019s hard to see a difference there. The A and B structures are identical in meaning, and both are common, although sometimes one or the other will fit better into a particular context.\n\nPLLHRR\n\nSome of you have come across the word **pllhrr**:\n\n**pllhrr** (vin., pll.HRR, inf 1,1) \u2018warn\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s identical in meaning and use to the word for \u2018warn\u2019 that you already know, **penghrr**.\n\nAnd parallel to **s\u00e4penghrr** \u2018warning,\u2019 we have:\n\n**s\u00e4pllhrr** (n., spll.HRR) \u2018warning\u2019\n\nLike its counterpart, it can be pronounced colloquially without the **\u00e4**: **spllhrr**.\n\nHow did Na\u2019vi come to have two slightly different words for the same thing? We can speculate. Looking at the &lt;ol&gt; form of both verbs\u2014**polenghrr** and **polhrr**\u2014we see they\u2019re quite similar. Assuming **penghrr** was the original word, we can imagine young Na\u2019vi hearing **polenghrr **in fast speech, where the middle syllable is unstressed, and thinking they\u2019re hearing **polhrr**. This would lead them to assume the original verb was **pllhrr**, which actually makes sense from a derivational point of view, with **pll** coming from **plltxe** \u2018speak.\u2019 (To warn, you can \u201ctell danger\u201d or \u201cspeak danger.\u201d) In time **pllhrr** came to be accepted as standard Na\u2019vi alongside **penghrr**.\n\nThe two different syntactic structures with **tung** and the two different words for \u2018warn\u2019 are examples of how language sometimes gives you a choice, where there are few if any consequences of choosing one possibility over the other.

Plumps alu Stefan requested clarification on the Na\u2019vi terminology for shooting, so let me share with you here what I told him:\n\nWe have two words that specifically mean \u2018shoot,\u2019 **tem** and **toltem**.\n\n**Tem** (vin.) is the intransitive \u2018shoot.\u2019 It talks about the action itself, without mentioning the weapon used or the object to be shot.\n\nIt\u2019s also the verb used to translate \u201cshoot at\u201d\u2014that is, the act of discharging a weapon towards someone or something with the intention of killing or maiming. In this construction, \u201cat\u201d is translated as **ne**:\n\n**Toltem** is vtr. Stress on the second syllable: **tol.TEM**. Infixes are 1, 2. The object is the person, animal, or thing shot and presumably injured or killed\u2014that is, the target of the shooting.\n\nNow note something interesting: In English we can say \u201cshoot an animal\u201d or \u201cshoot an arrow.\u201d These are both transitive constructions that take objects. But semantically they\u2019re very different. \u201cAnimal\u201d is the target; \u201carrow\u201d is the weapon used. Na\u2019vi distinguishes these. For the former we use **toltem**, for the latter we use **tsweykayon** \u2018cause to fly, let fly.\u2019 &nbsp;So \u2018shoot an arrow\u2019 is&nbsp;**swizawti tsweykayon. **(Since **tsweykayon** is a predictable infixed form, it\u2019s not listed separately in the dictionary.)\n\n**Hayalovay!**\n\n", "new vocabulary": [], "tags": []}, "Way Tiretu\u00e4\u2014The Shaman\u2019s Song": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2017/07/way-tiretua-the-shamans-song/", "content": "**Ma Eylan,**\n\nOver at LearnNavi.org., some folks took a stab at transcribing the Shaman\u2019s Song that\u2019s heard in Mo\u2019ara.\n\nUnderstanding sung lyrics isn\u2019t easy. If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ve often had to look up the lyrics to songs you find on the Internet, even if they\u2019re in your own language, since it can be hard to make out what the singer is saying. (Most singers, I think, concentrate more on singing beautifully than on enunciating the words clearly.) And of course there\u2019s a whole cottage industry of \u201cMisheard Lyrics,\u201d which can be pretty hilarious.

Note that there are two ways to say something is unfair: **\u201cKe lu mui\u00e4!\u201d** as in Avatar 1 (we now need to distinguish among A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5!), and **\u201cLu kemwi\u00e4!\u201d**\n\nDerivation:\n\n**t\u00eckemwi\u00e4** (n., t\u00ec.kem.WI.\u00e4) \u2018unfairness, injustice\u2019\n\n**leymkem** (vin., leym.KEM, inf 1,1) \u2018protest\u2019\n\nYou might think the **kem** part is the familiar word for \u2018act\u2019 or \u2018deed,\u2019 but in fact it\u2019s a truncated form of **kemwi\u00e4**. So the derivation is **leym** \u2018call out, cry out\u2019 + **kem(wi\u00e4)** \u2018unfair, unjustified\u2019\u2014that is, when you protest, you cry out that something is unfair. The verb is intransitive. When you protest something, use the topical case or **teri**-. To protest **that** something is unfair, we use the **tsn\u00ec** construction, which as you know is used for complements of certain intransitive verbs, like **s\u00eclpey** and **mowar si**.\n\nIn colloquial speech, the first m in **leymkem** often becomes ng by assimilation to the following k\u2014that is, it sounds like **leyngkem**, even though the spelling doesn\u2019t change.\n\nDerivations:\n\n**t\u00ecleymkem** (n., t\u00ec.leym.KEM) \u2018protesting, protest (abstract concept)\u2019\n\n**s\u00e4leymkem** (n., s\u00e4.leym.KEM) \u2018protest, instance of protesting\u2019\n\nA related word is:\n\n**leymfe\u2019** (vin., leym.FE\u2019, inf 1, 1) \u2018complain\u2019\n\nThis word derives from **leym** + **fe\u2019 **\u2018bad\u2019\u2014that is, to complain is to cry out that something is bad. The syntax is similar to that of **leymkem**.\n\nDerivations:\n\n**t\u00ecleymfe\u2019** (n., t\u00ec.leym.FE\u2019) \u2018complaining\u2019\n\n**s\u00e4leymfe\u2019** (n., s\u00e4.leym.FE\u2019) \u2018complaint\u2019\n\n**t\u00ecleym** (n., t\u00ec.LEYM) \u2018call\u2019\n\n**t\u00ectstunwinga\u2019** (adj., t\u00ec.TSTUN.wi.nga\u2019) \u2018kind (nfp)\u2019\n\nI realize I should have explained this earlier.

And just as you can say **N\u00ecngay plltxe nga**, \u2018You speak truly,\u2019 or \u2018What you say is true,\u201d you can also say **N\u00ectsleng plltxe nga**, \u2018You speak falsely.\u2019 Although the Na\u2019vi do not have a word for \u201cliar\u201d per se, they can express the idea that someone is lying through this construction.\n\n**kawl** (adv.) \u2018hard, diligently\u2019\n\n**yawntutsy\u00ecp** (n., YAWN.tu.tsy\u00ecp) \u2018darling, little loved one\u2019\n\nThis is a tender term of endearment that a parent might call a child, for example. It exists alongside **yawn(e)tu**, which for some speakers, although certainly not all, carries a romantic or sexual overtone. **Yawntutsy\u00ecp** often reflects parental or familial love.\n\nAnd on the opposite end of the spectrum:\n\n**vonv\u00e4\u2019** (n., von.V\u00c4\u2019) \u2018butthole, asshole, dickhead\u2019\n\nThis word is highly abusive and vulgar, and is never used in polite society. It\u2019s a strongly contracted form of **vitronv\u00e4\u2019**, which is sometimes heard in that fuller form. The word derives from **vitra** \u2018soul\u2019 + **onv\u00e4**\u2019 \u2018bad-smelling, stinking.\u2019 So a literal translation in English might be \u201cstinksoul.\u201d In colloquial pronunciation, the n is often lost and the preceding o nasalized: [v\u00f5.V\u00c4\u2019].\n\n**weopx** (n., we.OPX) \u2018wave (of water)\u2019\n\nNote: When viewed from the shore, waves can **srer** \u2018appear, come into view\u2019 and **\u2019\u00ecp** \u2018disappear, recede from view.\u2019\n\nDerivation:\n\n**leweopx** (adj., le.we.OPX) \u2018wave-like\u2019\n\n**ts\u00ecltsan** (n., ts\u00ecl.TSAN) \u2018good (abstract concept), goodness\u2019\n\nThis word evolved from ***t\u00ecs\u00ecltsan**, much the same way as ***t\u00ecs\u00eclpey** became **ts\u00eclpey**.\n\n**ler\u00ecn** (adj., le.R\u00ccN) \u2018wooden, of wood\u2019\n\n**letskxe** (adj., le.TSKXE) \u2018stony, of stone\u2019\n\nThese words can be used to indicate the material an object is made from. For example, to say \u2018a spear made of wood,\u2019 all of the following are possible:\n\n**mawftxele** (adv., maw.FTXE.le) \u2018belatedly, in hindsight, after the fact, as an afterthought\u2019\n\nThis word is parallel to **m\u00ecftxele** \u2018in this regard\u2019 and derived the same way.\n\n**p\u00ecsaw** (adj., p\u00ec.SAW) \u2018clumsy, accident-prone\u2019\n\nThis adjective describes a not-very-clever or impractical person. It can also be used as an interjection, for example when you\u2019ve acted clumsily with unintended negative results, often accompanied by a sharp intake of breath.\n\nDerivation:\n\n**t\u00ecpsaw** (n., t\u00ecp.SAW) clumsiness\n\nFinally, four expressions relating to Na\u2019vi culture or the Pandoran environment:\n\n**Txintseng** **Sawtutey\u00e4** (prop. n., TXIN.tseng SAW.tu.tey.\u00e4) \u2018Hell\u2019s Gate\u2019\n\nThis literally means \u2018The Sky People\u2019s Base.\u2019 It\u2019s how the Na\u2019vi refer to Hell\u2019s Gate.\n\n**txintseng** (n., TXIN.tseng) \u2018base of operations\u2019\n\n**lanay\u2019ka** (n., la.NAY\u2019.ka) \u2018slinger\u2019\n\nYou can find a description <a href=\"https://www.pandorapedia.com/fauna/forest/slinger.html\">here</a>.\n\n**ilu** (n., I.lu) \u2019ilu\u2019\n\nFrom the Disney pamphlet \u201dGuide to the Flora and Fauna of the Valley of Mo\u2019ara\u201d: \u201cThe ilu is a large plesiosaur-like sea creature that is the direhorse of the Pandoran ocean. With multiple fins/flippers and a long, streamlined shape, this aquatic pack animal serves the reef Na\u2019vi clans like direhorses serve the Na\u2019vi clans of the forests, jungles and planes.\u201d\n\n**sye\u2019otxang** (n., SYE.\u2019o.txang) \u2018wind instrument\u2019\n\nFrom **syeha** \u2018breath\u2019 + **\u2019otxang **\u2018musical instrument.\u2019 This is the generic term for any instrument played by blowing. A **pawk** is a kind of **sye\u2019otxang**.\n\nAs I don\u2019t have to tell some of you, I still have a considerable backlog of suggestions and questions from the LEP and others that I need to get to. I\u2019ll do that as soon as I can. **Tsakrrvay, fpom livu ayngaru n\u00ecwotx.**\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with a question. Someone recently asked me if **srak** can ever be used completely on its own. In other words, could someone ever say, simply, **\u201cSrak?\u201d** I responded that I had never considered that possibility but would think about it. What\u2019s your feeling? Are there any situations in which this could make sense? For example, suppose you\u2019ve asked a question and gotten no answer. If you then said \u201cSrak?\u201d angrily, could it mean, \u201cWell, are you going to answer me or not? Yes or no???\u201d And if you think you could use this question word this way, would it more likely be **\u201cSrake?\u201d**? **Rutxe ayngey\u00e4 ays\u00e4fp\u00eclit piveng oer!**\n\nTa Pawl\n\n", "new vocabulary": ["**kemwi\u00e4** (adj., kem.WI.\u00e4) \u2018improper, unfair, wrong, unjustified\u2019", "**t\u00eckemwi\u00e4** (n., t\u00ec.kem.WI.\u00e4) \u2018unfairness, injustice\u2019", "**leymkem** (vin., leym.KEM, inf 1,1) \u2018protest\u2019", "**t\u00ecleymkem** (n., t\u00ec.leym.KEM) \u2018protesting, protest (abstract concept)\u2019", "**s\u00e4leymkem** (n., s\u00e4.leym.KEM) \u2018protest, instance of protesting\u2019", "**leymfe\u2019** (vin., leym.FE\u2019, inf 1, 1) \u2018complain\u2019", "**t\u00ecleymfe\u2019** (n., t\u00ec.leym.FE\u2019) \u2018complaining\u2019", "**s\u00e4leymfe\u2019** (n., s\u00e4.leym.FE\u2019) \u2018complaint\u2019", "**t\u00ecleym** (n., t\u00ec.LEYM) \u2018call\u2019", "**t\u00ectstunwinga\u2019** (adj., t\u00ec.TSTUN.wi.nga\u2019) \u2018kind (nfp)\u2019", "**t\u00ecfl\u00e4nga\u2019** (adj., t\u00ec.FL\u00c4.nga\u2019) \u2018successful (nfp)\u2019", "**ekxan si** (vin., e.KXAN si) \u2018exclude, keep out, bar\u2019", "**n\u00ectsleng** (adv., n\u00ec.TSLENG) \u2018falsely\u2019", "**kawl** (adv.) \u2018hard, diligently\u2019", "**yawntutsy\u00ecp** (n., YAWN.tu.tsy\u00ecp) \u2018darling, little loved one\u2019", "**vonv\u00e4\u2019** (n., von.V\u00c4\u2019) \u2018butthole, asshole, dickhead\u2019", "**weopx** (n., we.OPX) \u2018wave (of water)\u2019", "**leweopx** (adj., le.we.OPX) \u2018wave-like\u2019", "**ts\u00ecltsan** (n., ts\u00ecl.TSAN) \u2018good (abstract concept), goodness\u2019", "**ler\u00ecn** (adj., le.R\u00ccN) \u2018wooden, of wood\u2019", "**letskxe** (adj., le.TSKXE) \u2018stony, of stone\u2019", "**mawftxele** (adv., maw.FTXE.le) \u2018belatedly, in hindsight, after the fact, as an afterthought\u2019", "**p\u00ecsaw** (adj., p\u00ec.SAW) \u2018clumsy, accident-prone\u2019", "**Txintseng** **Sawtutey\u00e4** (prop. n., TXIN.tseng SAW.tu.tey.\u00e4) \u2018Hell\u2019s Gate\u2019", "**txintseng** (n., TXIN.tseng) \u2018base of operations\u2019", "**lanay\u2019ka** (n., la.NAY\u2019.ka) \u2018slinger\u2019", "**sye\u2019otxang** (n., SYE.\u2019o.txang) \u2018wind instrument\u2019"], "tags": ["vocabulary", "colloquial", "discussion"]}, "More language for talking about language": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2017/10/more-language-for-talking-about-language/", "content": "**Fyape p\u00e4ngkxo fko teri l\u00ec\u2019fya leNa\u2019vi . . . n\u00ecNa\u2019vi?

The basic idea is that of consecutive words that \u201chang together\u201d as a unit. So, for example, take the sentence:\n\nSome of the **l\u00ec\u2019uk\u00ecngvi** in this sentence are:\n\nThese, however, are **not** **l\u00ec\u2019uk\u00ecngvi**:\n\n**l\u00ec\u2019kong** (n., L\u00cc\u2019.kong) \u2018syllable\u2019\n\n\u201cSyllable\u201d is another term that\u2019s tricky to define technically, but the basic idea is clear: a sequence of consonants and vowels that make up a rhythmic \u201cbeat\u201d in a word. For example, if you were singing the English word \u201cabsolutely\u201d or the Na\u2019vi word **f\u00echawre\u2019ti**, in each case you could put the word on four different notes corresponding to the four syllables in each one. The term **l\u00ec\u2019kong** comes from **l\u00ec\u2019u** + **\u2019ekong** \u2018rhythmic beat.\u2019 (Why not ***l\u00ecu\u2019kong**, you may ask? So that there\u2019s a greater distinction between the words for sentence and syllable. We have precedent for dropping the u of **l\u00ec\u2019u** in compounds\u2014**l\u00ec\u2019fya**, for example.)\n\n**l\u00ec\u2019uvi** (n., L\u00cc\u2019.u.vi) \u2018affix\u2019\n\nAn affix is a prefix, suffix, or infix.\n\n**eol\u00ec\u2019uvi** (n., E.o.l\u00ec\u2019.u.vi) \u2018prefix\u2019&nbsp; (that is, an affix that comes in front)\n\n**uol\u00ec\u2019uvi** (n., U.o.l\u00ec\u2019.u.vi) \u2018suffix\u2019&nbsp; (that is, an affix that comes behind)\n\n**syonl\u00ec\u2019u** (n., SYON.l\u00ec.u) \u2018adjective\u2019\n\n**Syon**, as you recall, means \u2018feature, trait, characteristic.\u2019\n\n**fyal\u00ec\u2019u** (n., FYA.l\u00ec.u) \u2018adverb\u2019\n\nAdverbs tell you how something is done.

Na\u2019vi adpositions (**hu**, **ta**, **eo**, **s\u00ecn**, **sre**, **tafkip** . . .) are \u201crelationship words.\u201d (Stefan pointed out the similar term in German, \u201eVerh\u00e4ltniswort\u201c, lit. \u2018relation word.\u2019)\n\nConsider these examples:\n\nIn A, **hu** is a **starl\u00ec\u2019u** but not a **l\u00ec\u2019uvi** or an **eol\u00ec\u2019u**.\n\nIn B, **hu** is a **starl\u00ec\u2019u**, a **l\u00ec\u2019uvi**, and an **uol\u00ec\u2019uvi**.\n\nFinally,\n\n**til\u00ec\u2019u** (n., TI.l\u00ec.u) \u2018conjunction\u2019\n\nThe elements here are **til** \u2018joint, hinge\u2019 + **l\u00ec\u2019u**. A conjunction (**s\u00ec**, **fu**, **sl\u00e4**, **txo**, **tengkrr**, . . .) is a kind of hinge or&nbsp;joint that links two things of the same sort.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: I hope these terms will be useful to those of us who enjoy grammatical discussions. But please don\u2019t get the idea that in order to speak and write Na\u2019vi well you need to know and understand them! Many excellent English speakers and writers\u2014probably most!\u2014would not be able to tell you what a subordinate conjunction is, or an infinitive, or a gerund, or any other technical grammatical term\u2014but they nevertheless use the language beautifully.

As you know, we already have a word meaning endless or boundless, **txewluke**. Although **t\u00ec\u2019iluke **and** txewluke **overlap to a certain extent, **t\u00ec\u2019iluke **usually has more of a temporal sense, describing something that goes on and on continually without end. A long, boring speech that seems endless, for example, would be described as **t\u00ec\u2019iluke.**\n\n**txanso\u2019hayu** (n., txan.SO\u2019.ha.yu) \u2018fan, enthusiast\u2019\n\nThe derivation is straightforward: **txan** \u2018much\u2019 + **so\u2019ha** \u2018be enthusiastic about\u2019 + **-yu** \u2018agentive suffix.\u2019 A shorter, more colloquial form of the word is simply **so\u2019yu**.\n\n**\u2019oktrr** (n., \u2019OK.trr) \u2018day of commemoration\u2019\n\nWe already have the familiar, general word **ftxoz\u00e4** meaning \u2018celebration,\u2019 which can be used in a wide variety of situations. But there are also words for more specific kinds of celebrations. **\u2019Oktrr**, literally \u2018remembrance day,\u2019 is used for any kind of commemorative anniversary, not necessarily a yearly one. To specifically refer to a yearly anniversary, we have:\n\n**z\u00ecs\u00ectsaltrr** (n., z\u00ec.s\u00ect.SAL.trr) \u2018(yearly) anniversary\u2019\n\nThe derivation is **z\u00ecs\u00ect** + **sal(ew)** + **trr**, i.e., \u2018year-pass day.\u2019 Colloquially, this becomes:\n\n**z\u00ectsaltrr** (n., z\u00ect.SAL.trr or z\u00ec.TSAL.trr) \u2018(yearly) anniversary\u2019\n\n(Note: I\u2019ve hedged on the syllabification here, since I think it\u2019s likely that the original **t**+**s** combination, in consecutive syllables, would coalesce into the **ts** phoneme.

The LEPers provided some very interesting examples from German, where \u201cdoch\u201d and \u201cnein\u201d are used in the answers to such questions, and asked if there\u2019s anything parallel in Na\u2019vi. This discussion won\u2019t cover every possibility, but it will at least make a start.\n\nNegative questions are a lot more complicated than they might seem\u2014at least that\u2019s what I\u2019m discovering! At first, it appears that a negative question simply turns a negative statement into a question: You aren\u2019t hungry. \u2013&gt; Aren\u2019t you hungry? I didn\u2019t see you yesterday. \u2013&gt; Didn\u2019t I see you yesterday? He has no shame. \u2013&gt; Has he no shame?\n\nBut what do those negative questions actually **mean**? What is the speaker trying to find out\u2014and trying to get across? In other words, even if the **syntax** is straightforward, what are the **semantics** of these questions?\n\nTake a simple positive question like \u201cAre you John?\u201d What\u2019s being asked? Well, the speaker is considering the statement \u201cYou are John\u201d and asking for confirmation: Is that statement true? In other words, \u201cYou are John\u2014true or false?\u201d If it\u2019s true, the other person answers \u201cYes,\u201d which means \u201cThe statement you\u2019re asking about is correct.\u201d A fuller answer would be, \u201cYes, I\u2019m John.\u201d If the statement is not correct\u2014if the person is in fact David, not John\u2014the answer is \u201cNo,\u201d which means \u201cThe statement you\u2019re asking about is not correct.\u201d So far so good.\n\nWhat happens, however, if the statement being turned into a question is negative? For example, \u201cYou are not John,\u201d which becomes the negative question \u201cAren\u2019t you John?\u201d If we follow the analysis in the previous paragraph, the speaker is considering the statement \u201cYou are not John\u201d and asking for confirmation: \u201cYou are not John\u2014true or false?\u201d A response of \u201cYes\u201d should then mean, \u201cThe statement you\u2019re asking about is correct\u2014I am not John.\u201d And \u201cNo\u201d should mean, \u201cThe statement you\u2019re asking about is incorrect\u2014I am indeed John.\u201d\n\nBut that is **not** what people usually mean when they ask such questions. When a speaker asks someone, \u201cAren\u2019t you John?\u201d there\u2019s a pre-existing belief on her part that this person is in fact John, and she\u2019s asking for confirmation of that belief. \u201cI believe you\u2019re John. That\u2019s correct, isn\u2019t it?\u201d An alternative form of the question gets this across more clearly: \u201cYou\u2019re John, aren\u2019t you?\u201d In this case, an answer of \u201cYes\u201d means, \u201cYour pre-existing belief is correct. I am John.\u201d And \u201cNo\u201d means \u201cYour pre-existing belief is incorrect. I am not John.\u201d Confused yet?\n\nI\u2019m happy to report that with **srak(e)** questions Na\u2019vi, such pre-existing beliefs don\u2019t enter the picture, and the situation is more straightforward. That is, a question of the form **Srake [X]** or **[X] srak** , where X is some statement, simply asks whether or not X is true. It doesn\u2019t matter whether X is a positive or a negative statement. An answer of **\u201cSrane\u201d** means that X is true. **Kehe** means X is not true. The questions do not imply any pre-existing beliefs on the part of the questioner. For example:\n\nHow, then, would you convey the idea of the English question \u201cAren\u2019t you Txew\u00ec?\u201d with its pre-existing belief? In Na\u2019vi it would simply be, **\u201cNga lu Txew\u00ec, kefyak?\u201d** That\u2019s exactly parallel to the English \u201cYou\u2019re Txew\u00ec, aren\u2019t you?\u201d which is to say, \u201cYou\u2019re Txew\u00ec\u2013isn\u2019t that true?\u201d And as in English, an answer of **\u201cSrane\u201d** means \u201cYour pre-existing belief is correct\u2014I am Txew\u00ec,\u201d while **\u201cKehe\u201d** means \u201cYour pre-existing belief is incorrect\u2014I\u2019m not Txew\u00ec.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s more to be said about this subject, but I think that\u2019s quite enough for now.&nbsp; \ud83d\ude42\n\nOh, by the way:\n\n**kx\u00ec** (intj.) \u2018hi, hiya\u201d\n\nThis was a nice suggestion from the LEP members for a more casual greeting than **kaltx\u00ec**, to be used among friends.\n\n**Hayalovay!**\n\n", "new vocabulary": [], "tags": ["vocabulary", "discussion"]}, "\u00b0100a L\u00ec\u2019u Amip! 64 New Words!

Also as in English, its meaning can be extended to events that are highly unusual, extraordinary, or unexpected.\n\nDerivations:\n\n**parulnga\u2019** (adj., pa.RUL.nga\u2019) \u2018miraculous\u2019 (nfp)\n\n**parultsy\u00ecp** (n., pa.RUL.tsy\u00ecp) \u2018term of affection for children\u2019\n\nA **parul** is more than unusual:\n\n**keltrrtrr** (adj., kel.TRR.trr) \u2018unusual\u2019\n\n(The derivation is obviously from **ke** + **letrrtrr**.)\n\nIt is in fact extraordinary:\n\n**txankeltrrtrr** (adj., TXAN.kel.TRR.trr) \u2018extraordinary\u2019\n\n**n\u00ectxankeltrrtrr** (adj., n\u00ec.TXAN.kel.TRR.trr) \u2018extraordinarily\u2019\n\nNext, some vocabulary based on new roots:\n\n**hafyon** (n., ha.FYON) \u2018wisdom\u2019\n\nNote that **hafyon** is more than just **t\u00ecomum** \u2018knowledge\u2019; it implies the mature judgment that comes from experience.\n\nDerivations:\n\n**lafyon** (adj., la.FYON) \u2018wise\u2019 (ofp)\n\nThis comes from **le** + **hafyon**, where ***lehafyon** has evolved over time to simply **lafyon**.\n\n**hafyonga\u2019** (adj., ha.FYO.nga\u2019) \u2018wise (nfp)\u2019\n\n(Here the **n** of **hafyon** has been absorbed by the **ng** of \u2013**nga\u2019**.)\n\nSo a wise leader is **eyktan lafyon**, while wise words are **ayl\u00ec\u2019u ahafyonga\u2019**.\n\n**fkxara** (n., FKXA.ra) \u2018stress (mental or emotional feeling)\u2019\n\n**fkxaranga\u2019** (n., FKXA.ra.nga\u2019) \u2018stressful\u2019\n\n**afpawng** (n., a.FPAWNG) \u2018grief\u2019\n\n**afpawng si** (vin.) \u2018grieve\u2019\n\n**keyn** (vtr.) \u2018put down\u2019\n\n**Keyn** is the opposite of **kxeltek** \u2018pick up.\u2019\n\nSome words connected with fire:\n\n**palon** (vin., PA.lon, inf. 1,2) \u2018burn\u2019\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen the transitive verb for \u2018burn,\u2019 **nekx**, which typically indicates fire burning or consuming something else. **Palon** is the intransitive \u2018burn\u2019:\n\n**rem** (n.) \u2018fuel\u2019\n\n**tong** (vtr.) \u2018put out, quench\u2019\n\nThe folks at the Disney theme park asked for some words to use with kids who are engaging in a coloring activity with crayons.

Blue specifically is **ta\u2019lengean** (\u201cskin **ean**\u201d) while green is **rikean** (\u201cleaf **ean**\u201d).

T\u00ectsyul**, on the other hand, is a general word for \u2018beginning\u2019 that\u2019s neutral as to time or place.\n\n**nawang&nbsp;**(vin., NA.wang, inf. 1, 2) \u2018merge, become one with\u2019\n\n**Nawang&nbsp;**implies that two things have come together to become one, so that the original separateness is lost.

I haven\u2019t done too much with Na\u2019vi these past few months, but there\u2019s some new vocabulary in this post that I hope you\u2019ll find useful.\n\nBut before that, two things: First, I finally corrected the entry for **n\u00ectxankeltrrtrr&nbsp;**\u2018extraordinarily\u2019 in the March 31 post, which had incorrectly listed the word as an adjective. It is, of course, and adverb. **Irayo n\u00ectxan, ma Eana Elf!&nbsp;**And by the way, if anyone discovers other errors in previous posts that still need to be corrected, please let me know!\n\nSecond, I want to express long-overdue thanks to our Neytiri for her excellent analysis of the differences between **vitra&nbsp;**\u2018soul\u2019 and **tirea&nbsp;**\u2018spirit\u2019 in the comment section of the previous post. If you haven\u2019t already seen it, I strongly suggest you take a look. **Lu ngey\u00e4 tsapost\u00ec lesar srunga\u2019s\u00ec n\u00ectxan, ma tsmuke. Ays\u00e4fp\u00ecl ngey sunu oer!**\n\nWe haven\u2019t yet had words for the specific months and seasons\u2014at least those **\u2019Rrtam\u00ec\u2014**so these new terms should fill in those gaps.\n\nFirst, recall that we already have vocabulary for the days of the week:\n\n**DAYS**\n\nThese clearly derive from **trr&nbsp;**plus the ordinal numbers. So Sunday is derived from \u201cfirst day,\u201d Monday from \u201csecond day,\u201d etc. It\u2019s important, however, to distinguish these derived compounds from the ordinary two-word phrases that still exist perfectly well in Na\u2019vi. For example, **Trrmrrve&nbsp;**and **trr amrrve**/**mrrvea trr&nbsp;**are both correct but differ in meaning.\n\n**MONTHS**\n\nGiven the days of the week, you might expect the names of specific months on Earth to be built on the same pattern. Since \u2018month\u2019 is **vospx\u00ec**, it would be natural to expect ***Vospx\u00ec\u2019awve&nbsp;**for \u2018January,\u2019 ***vospx\u00ecmuve&nbsp;**for \u2018February,\u2019 etc. As it turns out, however, the actual words are a bit different:\n\nAs you see, the month names are derived from **vospx\u00ec&nbsp;**along with the **cardinal **(one, two, three, . . . ), not the **ordinal&nbsp;**(first, second, third, . . . ) numbers. That is, January is \u201cMonth One,\u201d&nbsp;February \u201cMonth Two,\u201d and so on.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that some shortenings have taken place along the way. In particular, \u2018March\u2019 must originally have been ***Vospx\u00ecpxey**, but that quickly evolved to **Vospxey**.\n\nA note on pronunciation: Except in very careful speech, the normal conversational pronunciation of the unstressed **-spx\u00ec-**syllable in all these words is simply **-sp\u00ec-**, where the ejective becomes a simple stop. That\u2019s much easier to pronounce in fast, casual speech. The spelling, however, retains the **px**.\n\n**SEASONS**\n\nFor the temperate zones on earth, we have four seasons: summer, fall, winter, and spring. Does Pandora likewise have seasons? Let me defer once again to Neytiri on this question, from some private correspondence:\n\nSummer and winter are straightforward\u2014they\u2019re the hot and cold seasons on both **Eywa\u2019eveng** and **\u2019Rrta**, and are thus applicable in both places:\n\n**z\u00ecskrrsom**&nbsp;(n., z\u00ec.skrr.SOM) \u2018summer\u2019&nbsp; (from **z\u00ecs\u00eckrr asom**)\n\n**z\u00ecskrrwew**(n., z\u00ec.skrr.WEW) \u2018winter\u2019&nbsp; (from **z\u00ecs\u00eckrr awew**)\n\nFor the \u201ctransitional seasons,\u201d i.e. spring and fall, we have the following terms, which are applicable on earth but not necessarily on Pandora. (Whether the Na\u2019vi recognize spring and fall on Pandora is still to be determined.)\n\nOn earth, spring is the season of new growth:\n\n**paw&nbsp;**(vin.) \u2018grow\u2019\n\nThis is \u2018grow\u2019 in the sense of \u2018germinate and develop (of a plant).\u2019 It\u2019s distinct from&nbsp;**tsawl slu**, which implies \u201cgetting big\u201d and is also the term used for an animal that\u2019s growing up and maturing. So we have this contrast:\n\nWith that said,\n\n**t\u00ecpaw&nbsp;**(n., t\u00ec.PAW) \u2018growth\u2019\n\nAnd so we have:\n\n**z\u00ecskrr<u>mi</u>paw&nbsp;**(n., z\u00ec.skrr.MI.paw) \u2018spring\u2019 (from **z\u00ecs\u00eckrr a mipa t\u00ecpaw**, \u2018season of new growth\u2019)\n\nFall is the harvest season:\n\n**tsawn&nbsp;**(vtr.) \u2018gather growing food from the forest; pick; (in agriculture) harvest\u2019\n\nNote that **tsawn&nbsp;**is not quite the same as the word for \u2018gather\u2019 that you\u2019re already familiar with, **stars\u00ecm**.&nbsp;**Stars\u00ecm&nbsp;**is general: you can **stars\u00ecm&nbsp;**anything you can gather\u2014arrows, stones, even people. **Tsawn&nbsp;**is specifically for gathering or picking fruits or other plant-based foods from the forest. In cases where crops are planted and cultivated\u2014that is, where there is agriculture\u2014**tsawn&nbsp;**can be extended to include the meaning \u2018harvest.\u2019 (Since the Na\u2019vi mainly hunt and gather rather than plant crops, they tend to **tsawn** the entire year rather than restrict harvesting to the fall.

For the former, we of course use **yawne **plus the dative, as in **Nga yawne lu oer **\u2018I love you.\u2019 For the other kind of love:\n\nAs you\u2019ve seen by now, words incorporating **txan**are somewhat unpredictable as to stress (**txantsawl**but **txansngum**) and whether or not the n drops (**txantsawl **but **txav\u00e4\u2019**). So you have to pay attention to each new word!\n\n**zeykoyu **(n., zey.KO.yu) \u2018healer\u2019\n\n**t\u00ecranpam **(n., t\u00ec.RAN.pam) \u2018footstep (sound)\u2019\n\n**ftuopa **(adp-; FTU.o.pa) \u2019from behind\u2019\n\n**fyeng **(adj.) \u2018steep\u2019\n\n**kavan **(vtr., KA.van, inf. 1, 2) \u2019support (physically)\u2019\n\n**lepx\u00ecmrun **(adj., le,PX\u00ccM.run) \u2018common, often found\u2019\n\n**kelpx\u00ecmrun **(adj., kel,PX\u00ccM.run) \u2018rare\u2019\n\nThese two adjectives clearly derive from **px\u00ecm **\u2018often\u2019 and **run **\u2018find.\u2019\n\n**zung **(vin.) \u2018crouch\u2019\n\n**fpiv\u00ecl **(intj., fpi.V\u00ccL) \u2018hmm, let\u2019s see, let me think\u2019\n\nThis useful conversational expression translates the ubiquitous \u201cHmm\u201d in English, where you\u2019re thinking about or considering what\u2019s just been said. Literally, of course, it means \u201cLet (me) think.\u201d\n\n**kom **(vin. modal) \u2018dare\u2019\n\nSyntactically, **kom **behaves like **tsun **and **var**\u2014that is, it functions as a modal and requires the subjunctive (&lt;iv&gt;) form of following verb:\n\nNote that in English, \u201cdare\u201d sometimes takes an object: \u201cI dare you to tell him what you really think!\u201d But that\u2019s a different verb in Na&#8217;vi, something like \u201cchallenge,\u201d which we\u2019ll discuss another time.\n\n**mam **(vtr.) \u2018wrap\u2019\n\n**n\u00ectxukx **(adv., n\u00ec.TXUKX) \u2018deeply\u2019\n\nThe adverbial form of **txukx **is used both literally and metaphorically, as in English.\n\nTwo verbs related to **yom**:\n\n**yomvey **(vin., yom.VEY, inf. 1,1) \u2018dine on flesh, be carnivorous\u2019\n\nContrast this last example with:\n\n**yomzeswa **(vin., yom.ZE.swa, inf. 1,1) \u2018graze\u2019\n\nAgain, contrast this intransitive example with a transitive sentence like:\n\n**raw **(adp-) \u2018down to\u2019\n\nYou can also use **raw **for counting down to some number:\n\n**txap **(vtr.) \u2018press, press on, apply pressure to\u2019\n\nDerived noun:\n\n**t\u00ectxap **(n., t\u00ec.TXAP) \u2018pressure\u2019\n\nNote: This word is used only for physical pressure, not psychological or social pressure.\n\nTwo nouns related to the verb **emk\u00e4 **\u2018cross\u2019:\n\n**semk\u00e4 **(n., sem.K\u00c4) \u2018bridge\u2019\n\nAs you can guess, this word is derived from **s\u00e4\u2019o **\u2018tool\u2019 plus **emk\u00e4**, where the expected form ***s\u00e4emk\u00e4 **has evolved naturally into **semk\u00e4**.\n\n**emk\u00e4fya **(n., em.K\u00c4.fya) \u2018ford, crossing\u2019\n\n**fil **(n.) \u2018child\u2019s toy, plaything\u2019\n\n**sunkesun **(adv., SUN.ke.sun) \u2018like it or not\u2019\n\nThis is obviously a shortened form of **sunu ke sunu**.

Recall that the stressed **-nay **suffix creates new nouns that are a step down in some relevant hierarchy\u2014size, rank, accomplishment\u2014from the base noun. Here, Alpha Centauri B is the \u201cDeputy Sun,\u201d since it\u2019s a step down in brightness compared to A.\n\nAs for C, litte Proxima Centauri, the Na\u2019vi don\u2019t think of it as a sun at all but rather as the little lamp in the sky, Tawsnrrtsy\u00ecp, from **taw **\u2018sky\u2019 + **s\u00e4nrr **\u2018lamp\u2019 + **tsy\u00ecp **\u2018diminutive.\u2019\n\nColloquially, **Tawsnrrtsy\u00ecp **is often shortened to **Snrrtsy\u00ecp**.\n\nFinally, I want to introduce you to the important word\n\n**kuru **(n., KU.ru) \u2018neural queue\u2019\n\nYou\u2019re already familiar with the word **tswin**, which also refers to the neural queue. For now, we can consider the words to be interchangeable synonyms. It\u2019s possible, however, that as time goes on we\u2019ll be able to pinpoint a difference between the two. If and when that occurs, I\u2019ll be sure to update you. \n\nI have a number of grammatical questions I want to address along with more new vocabulary, so I\u2019ll be in touch again soon.\n\nIn the meantime, I hope everyone in Munich is having a fantastic time!

The idiomatic way to ask how far A is from B is simply: **Ftu A ne B pela\u2019a?**\n\n**pela\u2019a&nbsp;**(inter., pe.LA.\u2019a) \u2018how near, how far, what distance\u2019\n\nAs you might suspect, we also have the variant **la\u2019ape&nbsp;**(inter., LA.\u2019a.pe) meaning the same thing.\n\nNOTE: Alternate terms for **pela\u2019a&nbsp;**and **la\u2019ape&nbsp;**are:\n\n**pel\u00ecmsim&nbsp;**(inter., pe.L\u00ccM.sim) \u2018how near, how far\u2019\n\nand its variant **l\u00ecmsimpe **(inter., L\u00ccM.sim.pe).

I\u2019ll begin here with one about \u201cchoice questions,\u201d and report on the others in subsequent posts.\n\nThen, as a relief from the grammatical complications, we\u2019ll conclude here with some fun stuff.\n\nFirst, the grammar issue. The question\u2014and a very good one\u2014was posed by both Eana Unil and Tirea Aean. I hope Tirea doesn\u2019t mind if I quote him verbatim:\n\n**Ta Tirea Aean a t\u00ecpawm:**\n\nWhat is the best way to construct a choice-among-options question, e.g., \u201cX, or Y?\u201d\n\nCurrently, the only known methods to create a question are **srak** and **-pe+.** We realized that these don\u2019t quite cover questions of the form \u201cShould I stay or should I go?\u201d, \u201cDo you want to do X, or Y?\u201d, etc. It\u2019s our understanding that utterances such as **Nulnew ngal f\u00ec\u2019ut fu tsa\u2019ut** are statements even if there is a question-like intonation. Particularly for an option set where the options are not mutually exclusive, there is no real way to make it known that this is intended to be a question. What are your thoughts on this?\n\n**Oey\u00e4 t\u00ec\u2019eyng:**\n\nWe do it as follows: For a choice **statement**, use **fu** once, as you\u2019ve indicated. For a choice&nbsp; **question**, use it twice, before each of the two choices. For example:\n\nWhen **fu** appears before the first choice, it signals a question.\n\n**A Complication**\n\n\n[Edit Oct. 1\nNote: I\u2019ve revised this section to reflect the insights of two of our **sulf\u00e4tu l\u00ec\u2019fyay\u00e4**, Wll\u00ecm and Tirea Aean. **Irayo, ma mesmuk!**]\n\n\nThere\u2019s an added complication in this area: the \u201cA or B\u201d structure is actually ambiguous in English. For example, suppose I asked you, \u201cHave you studied Greek or Latin?\u201d I could be asking two different things. One might be, \u201cI know you\u2019ve studied one of those two languages. Which one is it?\u201d That would be a **choice question**. The other would be something like, \u201cIs it the case that you\u2019ve studied one of these two languages, Greek and Latin?\u201d We can call that a **non-choice question**. See the difference? It\u2019s a little hard to pin down, but the two interpretations ask different things. Interestingly, the sentence is only ambiguous in written form; in spoken English, the intonation is different for the two interpretations. (Do you agree?)\n\nNot all languages have this ambiguity. In Mandarin Chinese, for example, there are two different expressions for \u2018or,\u2019 which are used for the two different interpretations. You\u2019ll find a nice explanation&nbsp;<a href=\"https://eastasiastudent.net/china/mandarin/difference-hai-shi-huo-zhe/\">here</a>.&nbsp;(Scroll down to the section headed**\u6216\u8005****&nbsp;****in questions**. The coffee-tea examples are especially clear.)\n\nNa\u2019vi, unlike Mandarin, only has one word for \u2018or\u2019, **fu**, but it resolves the ambiguity in a different way. The non-choice question is actually a yes-no question. Going back to our previous example, it\u2019s equivalent to saying, \u201cIs it the case that you\u2019ve studied one of these two languages, Greek and Latin? Yes or no?\u201d And as a yes-no question, it requires **srake/srak**.\n\nExamples:\n\nAnd now for the promised fun stuff.\n\nWe already know a number of ways to express affection for people in Na\u2019vi. We have, for example**, yawnetu** and **yawntu&nbsp;**\u2018loved one,\u2019&nbsp;**yawntutsy\u00ecp** \u2018darling,\u2019&nbsp;**paskalin** \u2018adorable one\u2019 (literally, \u2018sweet berry\u2019), and **parultsy\u00ecp** \u2018little miracle\u2019 (a term of affection for children). But how do you express the opposite sentiment? How do you insult someone?\n\n**Kezemplltxe**, we have the famous word **skxawng** \u2018moron, idiot.\u2019 We can also call someone a **fnawe\u2019tu** \u2018coward.\u2019 And there\u2019s the very insulting, vulgar word **vonv\u00e4\u2019**, which we\u2019ve translated in English as \u2018asshole.\u2019 Here are a few more items to add to that list.\n\n**teylupil** (n., TEY.lu.pil) \u2018**teylu**-face\u2019\n\nA number of insults denigrate people\u2019s faces. (In English, we have several compounds where \u201cface\u201d is the second element: ____face. You can probably think of some ways to fill in the blank.) This somewhat childish Na\u2019vi insult actually degrades someone\u2019s facial stripes, implying they look like beetle larvae, which is not a compliment.\n\n**kalweyaveng** (n., kal.WEY.a.veng) \u2018son of a bitch\u2019\n\nThis insult derives from **kali\u2019weya**, a species of poisonous arachnid, and **eveng** \u2018child.\u2019 So calling someone a **kalweyaveng&nbsp;**is calling them the child of a poisonous spider. The closest expression we have in English that insults someone\u2019s lineage is probably \u2018son of a bitch.\u2019\n\n**txanfw\u00ecngtu** (n., txan.FW\u00ccNG.tu) \u2018bastard, loser\u2019\n\nYou already know the word **fw\u00ecng** \u2018humiliation.\u2019 Adding **txan**\u2013 at the beginning and \u2013**tu** at the end yields a word that refers to someone of extremely low social standing, a humiliated person, one who has totally lost face, the lowest on the totem pole. It\u2019s used as a term of derision. Perhaps the closest equivalent in English is \u2018bastard,\u2019 at least in its original sense of someone born in a degrading manner. **Txanfw\u00ecngtu** also has the sense of \u2018loser,\u2019 but it\u2019s much stronger than that English word.\n\nAnd finally,\n\n**kurkung** (n., KUR.kung) \u2018asshole\u2019\n\nThis is close to **vonv\u00e4**\u2019 but even more vulgar and insulting. It\u2019s a compound of **kuru** \u2018queue\u2019 and **kung** \u2018putrid, rotten.\u2019\n\n**kung** (adj.) \u2018putrid, fetid, rotten\u2019\n\n**Kung** can refer to rotten meat or a pile of dead and rotting animal matter in the forest.\n\nTo call someone\u2019s queue rotten is a powerful insult.\n\n**S\u00eclpey oe, aynga ke z\u00ecyevene fayl\u00ec\u2019ut sivar px\u00ecm n\u00echawng!**\n\nUntil the next time . . .\n\n", "new vocabulary": ["**teylupil** (n., TEY.lu.pil) \u2018**teylu**-face\u2019", "**kalweyaveng** (n., kal.WEY.a.veng) \u2018son of a bitch\u2019", "**txanfw\u00ecngtu** (n., txan.FW\u00ccNG.tu) \u2018bastard, loser\u2019", "**kurkung** (n., KUR.kung) \u2018asshole\u2019", "**kung** (adj.) \u2018putrid, fetid, rotten\u2019"], "tags": ["grammar", "discussion"]}, "Tengkrr Z\u00ecs\u00ect Leratem...

Why is it special? It\u2019s special because it\u2019s a friendship between a man and a Prolemuris. That had never happened before. Listen now how this friendship came about \u2026\n\nOne night, while a young man named \u00ccstaw had the watch at the border of his country, he suddenly heard a strange unexpected noise in the forest. He knew that there was no viperwolf pack nearby. But as a matter of fact he was familiar with every animal cry of the forest; therefore he knew that this cry had come from a Prolemuris. He decided to carefully step to the source of the sound.\n\nFinally he came upon a Prolemuris youngling that had a deep wound on its back from its right shoulder to its two left arms. It seemed the wound came from a bite of a viperwolf. Blood was coming out of it.\n\nAlthough \u00ccstaw approached carefully, the little creature was so afraid of that person that it wanted to quickly flee but neither climbing nor limping was possible. In order to calm down the little Prolemuris, \u00ccstaw offered it seeds and fruits which it accepted in the end. \u00ccstaw also spoke with the little creature calmly and softly and truly it seemed that the Prolemuris started to trust that young man.\n\nIt even allowed&nbsp; \u00ccstaw to put medicine, which he had already carried in his pouch, on the wound to stop the bleeding \u2013 and, thanks to Eywa, it was successful. For the next several nights \u00ccstaw stayed near the animal in order to protect it and keep tending to the wound.\n\nThe patience of the young Na\u2019vi was worth the while. Finally the animal could climb again and it was time to say goodbye. Before Prolemuris left, \u00ccstaw named him Syuku, and there is more to tell about their friendship \u2026 but this is for another time.\n\nMay they both have Eywa\u2019s blessing.\n\n\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\u2248\n\n**Srake fayskxekeng a mikyunfpi solunu ngaru?

I think you\u2019ll be able to understand it without the English translation:\n\nAnd to wrap up this round of listening exercises, here\u2019s a comment from Plumps on his story about an unusual friendship:\n\nThe idea of set phrases in storytelling, especially in stories for children, seems to be common to a lot of languages. In English, of course, we have the iconic \u201conce upon a time,\u201d which is used in no other contexts. When I was studying Persian, I came across a very interesting one: **\u201cYeki bud, yeki nabud.\u201d** Literally, this means \u201cOne was there, one wasn\u2019t there,\u201d or \u201cThere was one and there wasn\u2019t one.\u201d As some online commentators have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeki_Bud_Yeki_Nabud\">noted</a>, these words indicate that the story to come might be fact or fiction, true or not true, and they create a \u201cwarm, intimate feeling\u201d in the listener. Can you think of any other such phrases in other languages?\n\nMoving on to some new vocabulary:\n\n**tsawng** (vin.) \u2018shatter, break into pieces\u2019\n\nNote: There are several words for \u2018break\u2019 in Na\u2019vi. **Kxakx** is to snap or break into two pieces, like a twig. **Tsawng** is to shatter or break into many pieces, like a piece of pottery. If something is broken in the sense of no longer functioning correctly, it\u2019s **fwel**.\n\n**pon** (vtr.) \u2018balance\u2019\n\n(Note: In the above example, **zivup** and **tsawng** are \u201csequential verbs.\u201d As you recall, two verbs in sequence without a conjunction indicate that the second action occurs right after the first. In this case, **tsivawng** would be correct as well, since that verb is also in the scope of **tsun**; the cup **can** fall and **can** break.)\n\n**mei** (adj., ME.i) \u2018wet\u2019\n\n(I like the sound of **fwa fwi lu ftue**!)\n\nNote: Unlike **paynga\u2019**, which indicates that something is moist or damp, **mei** indicates complete wetness.\n\n**meitayo** (n., me.i.TA.yo) \u2018wetlands\u2019\n\nThis word is derived from **mei** \u2018wet\u2019 and **txayo** \u2018field, plain.\u2019 In colloquial speech, it\u2019s usually pronounced **meytayo**.\n\n**lipx** (vin.) \u2018drip\u2019\n\n**f\u00e4pyo** (n., F\u00c4P.yo) \u2018roof\u2019\n\nThis word comes from **f\u00e4pa** \u2018top\u2019 + **yo** \u2018surface.\u2019 (Cf. **kxemyo** \u2018wall, vertical surface\u2019)\n\nAnother Na\u2019vi proverb:\n\nThat is, persistent effort can accomplish unexpected and amazing things.\n\n**s\u00e4lipx** (n., s\u00e4.LIPX) \u2018drop (of a liquid)\u2019\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen the word **pay\u00ecva**, which specifically means \u2018drop of water.\u201d **S\u00e4lipx** is more general\u2014a drop of any liquid, for example tree sap or blood.\n\n**kxutslu** (n., KXU.tslu) \u2018risk\u2019\n\nThe evolution of this word occurred in several steps. Risk is the possibility (**t\u00ectsunslu**) of harm (**kxu**), or a harm-possibility. This evolved in Na\u2019vi as:\n\n**lekxutslu **(adj., le.KXU.tslu) \u2018risky\u2019\n\nFinally, a note on grammar:\n\nEven at this late date, there\u2019s a grammatical word we haven\u2019t yet seen.\n\nWe\u2019re all used to these familiar contractions that serve as conjunctions:\n\nThere\u2019s another one to add to that list, although it\u2019s used less frequently than the others.\n\nHow would you say, \u2018This message confirms that he will come\u2019?\n\nWell, \u2018confirm\u2019 is **kangay si**, a **si**-verb. As we know, **si**-verbs take objects in the dative case, as in **Srung si oeru!** \u2018Help me!\u2019 But here, the object of **kangay si** is not a noun or pronoun but rather a clause (\u2018that he will come\u2019). So we need a conjunction involving **f\u00ec\u2019u** in the dative case, which would be **f\u00ec\u2019uru** **a** or **f\u00ec\u2019ur a. **Just as **f\u00ec\u2019u a** contracts to **fwa**, **f\u00ec\u2019ur a **contracts to **fura**.\n\nSo our sentence is:\n\nI have a bit more to say about this topic, . . . **sl\u00e4 hayalo alahe**.\n\n", "new vocabulary": ["**tsawng** (vin.) \u2018shatter, break into pieces\u2019", "**pon** (vtr.) \u2018balance\u2019", "**mei** (adj., ME.i) \u2018wet\u2019", "**meitayo** (n., me.i.TA.yo) \u2018wetlands\u2019", "**lipx** (vin.) \u2018drip\u2019", "**f\u00e4pyo** (n., F\u00c4P.yo) \u2018roof\u2019", "**s\u00e4lipx** (n., s\u00e4.LIPX) \u2018drop (of a liquid)\u2019", "**kxutslu** (n., KXU.tslu) \u2018risk\u2019"], "tags": ["vocabulary", "grammar", "writing", "conversation", "colloquial", "discussion"]}, "Ulte Ayyora\u2019tu Leiu. . .

Thought you might be interested.\n\nIt\u2019s scheduled to air today, Fri. 22 May, at 20:32 UK time, which is&nbsp;21:32 in Germany, and in North America:&nbsp;3:32 PM EDT, 2:32 PM CDT, and 12:32 PM PDT. It\u2019s available here:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3cszv5n\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3cszv5n</a>\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be possible to hear it live in every location, but right after broadcast it should be available for a while at that site.\n\nThere\u2019s also a brief clip for social media that\u2019s exclusively devoted to Na\u2019vi, in which you\u2019ll be able to hear several Na\u2019vi speakers:\n\n<a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/we.tl/t-fwR5Jsswri__;!!LIr3w8kk_Xxm!90-7rGNC-EnFx2bOPvg1tVhl-ubpaoCCBV9c5gUgvNYPA15eBqQ4rzaoZ1IYiHT1_ygPLQ$\">https://we.tl/t-fwR5Jsswri</a>\n\nI\u2019m rarely entirely pleased with how I perform in these situations, thinking in retrospect how much more cogently I could have responded.

Fingers crossed. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nta P.\n\nADDENDUM\n\nWell, I just listened to the broadcast, and I guess my part of it wasn\u2019t too terrible. I thought they put together an interesting half hour, and I learned some new things myself.\n\nIf you have a chance, though, do listen to the brief clip in the second link above. You\u2019ll hear a lot more voices from our **l\u00ec\u2019fyaolo\u2019**.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re wondering about the closing credits in Na\u2019vi, which were partially cut off at the end of the broadcast, this is the complete version:\n\n\n*\nFuria yune f\u00ect\u00ecp\u00e4ngkxoti a ya\u2019\u00ecl\u00e4, irayo.\nTxo livu ayngaru t\u00ecpawm, tsat fpe\u2019 ayoer,\ntsakrr fmayi ayoey\u00e4 pongu \u2019iveyng.\n*\n\n\n\n\u2018Thank you for listening to this audio show.<span class=\"apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;__\nIf you have a question, send it in,\nand the team will try to answer it.\u2019\n\n\nAs you see, for \u2018audio show\u2019 I used *t\u00ecp\u00e4ngkxo a ya\u2019\u00ecl\u00e4*\u2014a discussion through the air. &nbsp;\ud83d\ude0a\n\n", "new vocabulary": [], "tags": ["discussion"]}, "T\u00ecpusawm, T\u00ec\u2019useyng, s\u00ec \u2019Okvur a Eltur T\u00ectxen Si - Asking, Answering, and an Interesting Story": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2020/05/tipusawm-tiuseyng-si-okvur-a-eltur-titxen-si-asking-answering-and-an-interesting-story/", "content": "**Kx\u00ec ma frapo,**\n\nToday\u2019s post has three things I hope will be of interest: first, a discussion about asking and answering; next, a (possibly) new way of asking about someone\u2019s well-being; and finally, another contest-winning entry.\n\n**Asking and Answering**\n\nThrough some private discussions, I realized it might be a good idea to summarize some of the grammatical structures related to asking and answering questions in Na\u2019vi. There\u2019s not a lot of new information here, but I hope that collecting it all in one place will be useful.\n\n**pawm** (vtr., vin.) \u2018ask\u2019\n\n**Pawm** is both a transitive and an intransitive verb.\n\n**<u>Transitive use:</u>**\n\nThe only thing you ever ask is a question, so the object of transitive **pawm** is always **t\u00ecpawmit**. But that word can be modified:\n\nAnd note:\n\nWe use **ta** here rather than the dative case (**oeru**). Think of asking as a request for something **from** someone.\n\n**<u>Intransitive use:</u>**\n\nAlternatively, **san . . . s\u00eck** in the above sentence may be omitted, with the same meanings:\n\n**\u2019eyng** (vin.) \u2018answer, respond, respond to\u2019\n\nUnlike **pawm**, **\u2019eyng** is always used intransitively. So the \u201cobject\u201d of \u2018answer\u2019 is in the topical:\n\nOther examples:\n\nNow for the conversational expression:\n\nWe\u2019re all very familiar with **Ngaru lu fpom srak?** as a polite conversational formula for asking about someone\u2019s well-being. Along these lines, there\u2019s another useful question, which you might anticipate from **makto zong**\u2014literally, \u2018ride safely,\u2019 which uses **zong** \u2018save\u2019 as a shorthand expression for **n\u00eczawnong** \u2018safely,\u2019 an adverb that obviously comes from **zong**. In conversation, it means \u2018Take care,\u2019 \u2018Travel safe,\u2019 \u2018Stay well,\u2019 etc. The related question is:\n\n**Makto fyape?**\n\nLiterally, this means \u2018How ride?\u2019, or in better English, \u2018How\u2019s the riding?\u2019 The difference between this and **Ngaru lu fpom srak?** is that **Makto fyape?** is more general. It doesn\u2019t necessarily ask about you yourself but rather about your whole situation, corresponding to colloquial English questions like \u201cHow are things?\u201d \u201cHow\u2019s everything going?\u201d \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d\n\nResponses are often single adverbs, such as:\n\n\n**Zong.**&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \u2018Well.\u2019 (Again, short for **n\u00eczawnong**, implying \u2018Everything\u2019s OK.\u2019)\n**N\u00ecltsan.**&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \u2018Well.\u2019\n**N\u00ecksman.**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2018Wonderfully.\u2019\n**N\u00ecksran.**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2018So-so.\u2019\n**N\u00ecfe\u2019.**&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\u2018Badly.\u2019\n**N\u00ecfpxamo.**&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \u2018Terribly, horribly.\u2019\nEtc.\n\n\nA typical little dialog:\n\nAnd finally, here is our third contest-winning entry, a beginners-level story by Tseyla.

I hope you\u2019re doing well\u2014or, as it\u2019s become customary to add these days, as well as can be expected under the circumstances. After some personal and professional distractions, it\u2019s nice to be back here!\n\nHere are a few new vocabulary items that should fill in some gaps. Most of these, as you\u2019ll see, are action verbs, some of which came from the **l\u00ec\u2019fyaolo\u2019**. You\u2019ll also find a few conversational expressions to use when you speak or write.\n\n**he\u2019a** (vin., HE.\u2019a, inf. 1,2) \u2019cough\u2019\n\nI don\u2019t actually recall if I saw any of the Na\u2019vi cough in **Avatar**, but since their physiology is similar to ours in many ways (their vocal tract, for example), I\u2019m assuming they do.\n\nDerived noun:\n\n**s\u00e4he\u2019a** (n., s\u00e4.HE.\u2019a) \u2018a cough, instance of coughing\u2019\n\n**fwal** (vtr.) \u2018wipe\u2019\n\n**p\u00ect\u00eck** (vtr., P\u00cc.t\u00eck, inf. 1,2) \u2018scratch non-harmfully, as an itch\u2019\n\n**tsupx** (vtr.) \u2018scratch harmfully, as with a claw\u2019\n\nNa\u2019vi has two different words for \u2018scratch.\u2019 For scratching that\u2019s pleasurable or relieves an itch, use **p\u00ect\u00eck**. For the kind of scratching that\u2019s painful, draws blood, or does other harm, such as scratching yourself with a pin or being scratched by the claws of an animal, use **tsupx**.\n\nNote a couple of things about the previous example. First, **fkxake** \u2018itch\u2019 is an intransitive verb whose subject is the body part or place that itches. Also, you\u2019ll see the colloquial idiom **[Verb] n\u00ecftxan kuma terkup**, which has been translated above as \u2018like crazy.\u2019 Literally, it\u2019s saying that an action is so intense that it results in dying. We have similar exaggerations in English, e.g. \u201cThat movie bored me to death.\u201d\n\n**ngungung** (vtr., NGU.ngung, inf. 1,2) \u2018rub\u2019\n\n**lonusye** (vin., lo.NU.sye, inf. 1,2) \u2018exhale; blow\u2019\n\nThis is clearly a compound from **lonu** \u2018release, let go\u2019 and **syeha** \u2018breath.\u2019\n\nNote the use of **ne** in the above example, since blowing **on** something is really directing a stream of air **towards **it.\n\n**mungsye** (vin., MUNG.sye, inf. 1,1) \u2019inhale\u2019\n\nAnother clear compound, this one from **munge** \u2018take\u2019 and **syeha**.\n\n**txeptsy\u00ecp** (n., TXEP.tsy\u00ecp) \u2019flame\u2019\n\nIn the above example, note the two adjacent verbs indicating consecutive action. \u201cBlowing out\u201d a flame is to release breath and thereby extinguish it.\n\nFinally, some colloquial and conversational expressions:\n\nColloquial forms of \u2018push\u2019 and \u2018pull\u2019:\n\n**k\u00e4r\u00ecp** (vtr., K\u00c4.r\u00ecp, inf. 1,2) \u2018push\u2019&nbsp; (Cf. **k\u00e4\u2019\u00e4r\u00ecp**)\n\n**z\u00e4r\u00ecp** (vtr., Z\u00c4.r\u00ecp, inf. 1,2) \u2018pull\u2019&nbsp; (Cf. **za\u2019\u00e4r\u00ecp**)\n\nThese colloquial forms are more common in speech than the full forms.\n\nConversational expressions:\n\nResponses:\n\n**la\u2019ang** (n., LA.\u2019ang) \u2018pile of stinking, rotting animal matter\u2019\n\nThe above expression, as you might guess, is very strong and rather coarse, more so than the English translation. Nowadays, unfortunately, there seem to be plenty of occasions to use it.\n\n**Hayalovay, ma smuk.**\n\n", "new vocabulary": ["**s\u00e4he\u2019a** (n., s\u00e4.HE.\u2019a) \u2018a cough, instance of coughing\u2019", "**fwal** (vtr.) \u2018wipe\u2019", "**p\u00ect\u00eck** (vtr., P\u00cc.t\u00eck, inf. 1,2) \u2018scratch non-harmfully, as an itch\u2019", "**tsupx** (vtr.) \u2018scratch harmfully, as with a claw\u2019", "**ngungung** (vtr., NGU.ngung, inf. 1,2) \u2018rub\u2019", "**lonusye** (vin., lo.NU.sye, inf. 1,2) \u2018exhale; blow\u2019", "**k\u00e4r\u00ecp** (vtr., K\u00c4.r\u00ecp, inf. 1,2) \u2018push\u2019&nbsp; (Cf. **k\u00e4\u2019", "**z\u00e4r\u00ecp** (vtr., Z\u00c4.r\u00ecp, inf. 1,2) \u2018pull\u2019&nbsp; (Cf. **za\u2019", "**la\u2019ang** (n., LA.\u2019ang) \u2018pile of stinking, rotting animal matter\u2019"], "tags": ["vocabulary", "conversation", "colloquial", "discussion"]}, "H\u00ec\u2019ia vur a teri mefalukantsy\u00ecp - A little story about two cats": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2020/08/hiia-vur-a-teri-mefalukantsyip-a-little-story-about-two-cats/", "content": "**Kaltx\u00ec, ma frapo!**\n\nIt\u2019s my pleasure to present to you a little story, written by our Tsm.

Or you could take a look at my English translation here:\n\n**Part 1**\n\nOne day a little thanator walked alone through the forest. His mother had wanted him to go to sleep, but he didn\u2019t feel tired, so he left without her noticing. He had no goal in mind, but felt happy that he could explore the great forest.\n\nThat same day, a young Na\u2019vi left his village. The other children had said malicious things about him because he was often afraid, so he went to the forest to escape the humiliation. He had no aim, but after a little while he felt happy again because he was free and alone.\n\nWhile the boy walked through the forest, he didn\u2019t notice that someone was following and watching him. The little thanator was curious, and the Na\u2019vi interested him, so he wanted to know what the boy was up to. Thanators are naturally enemies of the Na\u2019vi, but this thanator was young and didn\u2019t know that.\n\nAfter walking through the forest a long time, the boy heard an unexpected sound and turned quickly towards it. He saw a little thanator that had been snapping branches. The young Na\u2019vi was familiar with stories about terrifying thanators that killed people, but this youngster didn\u2019t seem like a dangerous animal.\n\nThe two of them looked at each other for a long time, curiously and silently. They weren\u2019t afraid. This thanator seemed cute to the boy and the thanator thought he could play with the Na\u2019vi. The young Na\u2019vi seemed to think the same, so the two of them began to chase each other through the forest. At night, the boy said to the thanator, \u201cI have to go, thanator, but I\u2019ll come back.\u201d\n\n", "new vocabulary": [], "tags": ["writing"]}, "Paul in a Polish Podcast!": {"link": "http://naviteri.org/2020/10/paul-in-a-polish-podcast/", "content": "Well, OK, the podcast is in English, but it does have a Polish introduction. :-)\n\nBack in July, I was interviewed for a podcast by a Polish journalist and language enthusiast, B\u0142a\u017cej Grygiel, who\u2019s the content manager for a language services company in Warsaw.
