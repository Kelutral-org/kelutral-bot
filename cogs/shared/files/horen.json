For example, in **ayoel tarmaron tsawla yerikit** *we were hunting a large hexapede*, I cannot break apart the direct object constituent **tsawla yerikit** and produce things like \\***tarmaron tsawla ayoel yerikit** or \\***ayoel tsawla tarmaron yerikit**.",

				"info" : "Each human language has its own rules and tendencies about when the topical should be used. At this stage it is a little difficult to set rules for this, but a few tendencies can be drawn from what we have seen so far. First, so far Frommer has not used topic=comment constructions nearly as often as it is used in Chinese or Japanese (both topic-prominent languages, though each in their own way). Second, Frommer does not use the topical to introduce new matters for discussion, rather topics refer to current matters, or matters which are readily inferable from the conversation.\nEnglish uses the definite article, *the*, to mark information that has already been introduced into discourse, as well as information that can be assumed or deduced from the conversation. For example, if I say, \"I wanted to see *Avatar*, but the line was too long,\" I can use the definite article with *line* not because we've been talking about lines, but because standing in line is something we're used to when seeing a popular film. In comments on a recent blog post 5 Frommer says,\n```But if the message is indefinite, the topical case doesn't work as well, since topics are usually definite. So 'upxareri ngaru pamrel soli trram can certainly mean I wrote you THE message yesterday. Can it also mean I wrote you A message yesterday? Since there are no articles per se in Na'vi and nouns can be either definite or indefinite, I guess it could. But something about it rubs me the wrong way.```\nIt seems best to avoid indefinite topicals for now."
